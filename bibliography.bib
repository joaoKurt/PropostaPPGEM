  abstract = {A code was developed for numerical simulations of both nano- and micron-sized aluminum dust combustion in air. This code incorporates a combustion model that provides a comprehensive framework for modeling the burning of an aluminum particle under a transition regime, enabling accurate modeling of aluminum dust combustion across a wide range of particle sizes. The pseudo-transient approach was employed to solve the steady multiphase governing equations of aluminum dust combustion. The predicted variation trend of burning velocity with varying dust concentration exhibits good agreement with experimental measurements for both nano- and micron-sized aluminum dust combustion. Analyses exploring the effects of dust concentration, oxygen volume fraction and thermophoretic force on aluminum dust combustion were conducted. Simulation results indicate that introducing thermophoretic force in micron-sized aluminum dust combustion further enhances burning velocities and increases flame thicknesses compared to nano-sized aluminum dust combustion, primarily attributed to reduced gas entrainment of micron-sized aluminum particles.}

  abstract = {Turbulent combustion will remain central to the next generation of combustion devices that are likely to employ blends of renewable and fossil fuels, transitioning eventually to electrofuels (also referred to as e-fuels, powerfuels, power-to-x, or synthetics). This paper starts by projecting that the decarbonization process is likely to be very slow as guided by history and by the sheer extent of the current network for fossil fuels, and the cost of its replacement. This transition to renewables will be moderated by the advent of cleaner engines that operate on increasingly cleaner fuel blends. A brief outline of recent developments in combustion modes, such as gasoline compression ignition for reciprocating engines and sequential combustion for gas turbines, is presented. The next two sections of the paper identify two essential areas of development for advancing knowledge of turbulent combustion, namely multi-mode or mixed-mode combustion and soot formation. Multi-mode combustion is common in practical devices and spans the entire range of processes from transient ignition to stable combustion and the formation of pollutants. A range of burners developed to study highly turbulent premixed flames and mixed-mode flames, is presented along with samples of data and an outline of outstanding research issues. Soot formation relevant to electrofuels, such as blends of diesel-oxymethylene ethers, hydrogen-methane or ethylene-ammonia, is also discussed. Mechanisms of soot formation, while significantly improved, remain lacking particularly for heavy fuels and their blends. Other important areas of research, such as spray atomization, turbulent dense spray flames, turbulent fires, and the effects of high pressure, are briefly mentioned. The paper concludes by highlighting the continued need for research in these areas of turbulent combustion to bring predictive capabilities to a level of comprehensive fidelity that enables them to become standard reliable tools for the design and monitoring of future combustors.}

DFSW modeling strategies derived for single-phase flows are extended to improve the characterization of the mixture stratification encountered in dilute spray flames. The two-phase flow is described following an Eulerian-Lagrangian approach within the Large Eddy Simulation (LES) framework under consideration of two-way coupling between both gaseous and liquid phases. In particular, combustion reactions are captured by means of the Flamelet Generated Manifold (FGM) method. An evaporation model accounting for the inter-phase non-equilibrium is applied to address droplet's heat and mass transfer. Main aspects of the suggested DFSW modeling strategy are systematically analyzed. The obtained results demonstrate fair improvements not only in the estimation of the flame structure, but also in the prediction of the spray properties in comparison to a reference model and the available experimental data.

Analyses are conducted in terms of numerical simulations using a detailed description of the chemistry. Herein, different reaction mechanisms are employed to represent the combustion of methane. Simulations were performed with the computational fluid dynamics (CFD) code CHEM1D following different numerical setups, freely propagating flame, counter flow flame, and propagating flame in droplet mist reactors. The employed method is validated against experimental data and simulation results available in the literature. While the counter-flow flame reactor is exclusively used in the validation stage, different scenarios have been established for propagating flame simulations, as in single- or two-phase flow configuration. These comprehend variations in diluent compositions, reaction mechanisms, and different models to account for diffusion transport. Conducted investigations show that the choice for a specific reaction mechanism can interfere with computed flame speed values, which may agree or deviate from experimental observations. The achieved outcomes from these investigations indicate that the so-called GRI 3.0 mechanism is the best option for general application purposes, as a good balance is found between accuracy and computational efforts. However, in cases where more detailed information and accuracy are required, the CRECK C1-C3 mechanism demonstrated to be the best choice from the evaluated mechanisms. Additionally, the results clearly indicate that commonly applied simplifications to general flame modeling as the unitary Lewis number and mixture averaged approach strongly interfere with the computation of flame propagation speed values for single- and two-phase flows. While the application of unitary Lewis number approach is limited to certain conditions, the mixture averaged approach demonstrated a good agreement with the complex model for flame speed computations in the various tested scenarios. Such an outcome is not limited to oxy-fuel applications, but are straightly extensible to oxy-steam and air-blown combustion.},

These droplets are subject to heat and mass transfers in a vast range of atmosphere configurations, resulting in complex interactions. This example of spray combustion summarizes the diversity of scenarios that a droplet may experience in a spray flow. Unfortunately, available models in the literature exhibit limitations for characterizing such complex interactions. This work proposes a novel modeling strategy to account for such interactions in diverse scenarios grounded in a consistent computational approach. We derive a new formulation from general transport equations of the gas phase. We validate the resulting model by comparing numerical results with available experimental data and consider binary mixtures of liquids evaporating in different ambient conditions. Compared to other reference approaches, the proposed model proves to be efficient in all tested scenarios, including severe atmosphere compositions and states. Additional differential diffusion effects among participating species are observed, not only for mass but also for heat transfer.}

While many contributions focus on the description of the mass transfer, details about the energy formulation to describe the droplet's heat transfer are seldom developed in the literature. This work demonstrates that a general gas-phase energy formulation can be obtained independently from the species diffusion transport modeling while incorporating multi-species enthalpy diffusion terms with a simple expression. Considering the ideal gas simplification, it is shown that a simple choice of specific heats is sufficient to characterize the inclusion or not of multi-species enthalpy diffusion effects. Furthermore, it is also demonstrated that the final energy expression degenerates in the single-component limit to the same energy formulation as in the model of (Abramzon and Sirignano, Int. J.

Modeling strategies often rely on simplifying assumptions such as Fick's law or the Hirschfelder and Curtiss' approximation. This work seeks to propose a droplet mass transfer formulation based on the Stefan-Maxwell equations without simplifying assumptions for diffusion closures. Such an option has already been investigated by Tonini and Cossali (Int. J. Heat and Mass Transfer, 2016). However, critical simplifications were employed in the analytical developments. In this work, we relax these simplifications with a final model that handles any number of species in general phase-change scenarios (evaporation and/or condensation), applicable to convective environments, and with no hypotheses for the diffusion coefficients' structure, such that it can be regarded as a reference. To show the impact of diffusion simplifications, this formulation is compared with two other approaches representing most mass transfer models used by the literature. In particular, the model originally proposed by Law (Combust. and Flame, 1976) is detailed here since its core results are still among the most used. The proposed formulation is validated with experimental data, and simulations are conducted for droplets of multiple fuel compositions with fixed or varying conditions at the far-away state to map diverse scenarios.}

In this context, hydrophilic fuels are of particular importance, since they are expected to interact with the water formed during combustion reactions. The impact of such interactions onto the reaction process is still not explored enough. This work aims to contribute to the understanding of such interactions by investigating the impact of accurately describing the heat and mass transfers on hydrophilic fuel droplets interacting with flames. For that, a recently proposed phase change model is employed, demonstrated to be one of the few capable of characterizing the differential diffusion of vapor into the gas phase for hydrophilic fuels interacting with reacting flows. Numerical simulations of freely propagating flames in quiescent droplet mists are conducted with a detailed chemistry description. Different scenarios focus on the impact of water addition in the gaseous or liquid phase. Results demonstrated the multi-component phase change significantly impacts the flame speed in humid air and/or with hydrous ethanol, and neglecting this effect leads to strong miscalculation in flame speed. This is shown to be a consequence of the hydrophilic property of the chosen fuel, which allows the conversion from single-component to multi-component droplets, thus modifying the flame structure. Novelty and significance statement ‚Ä¢Differential diffusion is rigorously accounted for with a new phase change model in flames propagating in droplet mists of a hydrophilic fuel, i.e., ethanol.‚Ä¢The multi-component modeling is necessary even when considering the injection of pure hydrophilic fuel.‚Ä¢When the multi-component description of the liquid fuel is enabled, flame speeds become higher than those values achieved with the single-component approach.‚Ä¢Air humidity interacts with hydrophilic fuel droplets delivering higher flame speed values.‚Ä¢A novel justification is presented for the observed higher flame speed values of flames propagating in droplet mists when compared to single-phase flames.}

  abstract = {The differential diffusion of vapor species into the carrier gas flow strongly impacts the heat and mass transfer processes associated with multi-component droplets. While the importance of this phenomenon has been demonstrated for reacting spray flows, an evaluation of the most suitable method for its modeling is wanted. Recently, a new model was proposed (Sacomano Filho et al., Int. J. Heat and Mass Trans, Vol. 194, 2022) which rigorously accounts for the differential diffusion of species vapor into the carrier gas while allowing both evaporation and condensation of species at the same time. This model is used here as a reference and it is compared to two other models that have been used in combustion applications, based on stronger simplifications. While one neglects the differential diffusion of vapor into the gas, the other model follows from an important simplification hypothesis. With the objective to investigate the performance of these three models in terms of both their representation of physical phenomena and computational efficiency, simulations involving hydrophilic fuels are performed. Initially, simulations in single-droplet setup are conducted in non-reacting atmospheres with three main purposes: (1) validate implementations; (2) indicate model deviations; and (3) evaluate computational costs. Next, to analyze the performance of the three models in reacting flows, simulations of freely propagating spray flames are considered. Although deviations between models are noticed, results indicate the simplified differential diffusion model as a feasible choice to recover the main characteristics of a spray flame. In contrast, the omission of the differential diffusion description may lead to substantial deviations in various flame and spray parameters. Overall, the reference model is recommended as the most robust and rigorous approach for general spray flows, while the simplified differential diffusion approach, denoted here as Partial-DD, can offer the best compromise between accuracy and computational cost once it is rigorously verified for a specific set of conditions.}

  abstract = {In a real turbulent spray flame, dispersion, continuous phase turbulence modification, dispersed phase inter-particle collisions, evaporation, mixing and combustion occur simultaneously. Dealing with all these complexities and their interactions poses a tremendous modeling task. Therefore, in order to advance current modeling capabilities, it seems reasonable to aim for progress in individual sub-areas like breakup, dispersion, mixing and combustion, which however cannot be viewed in complete isolation. Further, one has to consider advantages and disadvantages of the general modeling approaches, which are direct numerical simulation (DNS), large eddy simulation (LES), simulations based on Reynolds averaged equations and probability density function (PDF) methods. Not least one also has to distinguish between Eulerian and Lagrangian dispersed phase descriptions. The goal of this paper is to provide a review of computational model developments relevant for turbulent dilute spray combustion, i.e. the dense regime, including collisions as well as primary and secondary atomization, is not covered. Also not considered is breakup in dilute sprays, which can occur in the presence of sufficiently high local turbulence. It is intended to guide readers interested in theory, in the development and validation of predictive models, and in planning new experiments. In terms of physical phenomena, the current understanding regarding turbulence modification due to droplets, preferential droplet concentration, impact on evaporation and micro-mixing, and different spray combustion regimes is summarized. In terms of modeling, different sets of equations are discussed, i.e. the governing conservation laws without and with point droplet approximation as employed by DNS, the filtered equations considered in LES, the Reynolds averaged equations, and Lagrangian evolution equations. Further, small scale models required in the context of point droplet approximations are covered. In terms of computational studies and method developments, progress is categorized by the employed approaches, i.e. DNS, LES, simulations based on Reynolds averaged equations, and PDF methods. In terms of experiments, various canonical spray flame configurations are discussed. Moreover, some of the most important experiments in this field are presented in a structured way with the intention to provide a database for model validation and a guideline for future investigations.}

One of the main objectives is to emphasize the progress made in the mathematical description and understanding of reactive spray flows by incorporation of rationally derived simplifications based on the disparity of length and time scales present in the problem. In particular, we aim to show how the disparity of the scales that correspond - with increasing values of their orders of magnitude - to the droplet size, interdroplet spacing, and width of the spray jets, ensures the validity of their homogenized description. The two-way coupling associated with exchanges of mass, momentum, and energy between the gas and the liquid phases is dominated by the homogenized exchanges with the gas provided collectively by the droplets, and not by the direct interaction between neighboring droplets. The formulation is used as a basis to address nonpremixed spray diffusion flames in the Burke-Schumann limit of infinitely fast chemical reactions, with the conservation equations written in terms of chemistry-free coupling functions that allow for general nonunity Lewis numbers of the fuel vapor. Laminar canonical problems that have been used in the past to shed light on different aspects of spray-combustion phenomena are also discussed, including spherical spray clouds and structures of counterflow spray flames in mixing layers. The presentation ends with a brief account of some open problems and modeling challenges.}

  abstract = {Turbulent multiphase combustion plays an important role in both nature (e.g., volcanos and pool fires) and industry (e.g., industrial furnaces, aeroengines, and internal combustion engines). It is a highly complex multiscale and multi-physicochemical process in which interactions between the dispersed and continuous phases, phase change, droplet collisions, evaporation, mixing, heat transfer, and chemical reactions occur simultaneously. In recent years, significant progress has been made in understanding the mechanisms of spray flames and their behaviors in combustion engines. This paper covers key and representative developments in the area of turbulent spray combustion with a focus on spray-chemistry-turbulence interactions. The effects of turbulence-chemistry, spray-turbulence, and spray-chemistry interactions on the spray process, ignition, flame stabilization and emission are comprehensively discussed at elevated pressures and temperatures. Furthermore, spray-radiation and spray flame-wall interactions, which are important to engine performance and emission characteristics, are scrutinized. Supercritical spray flames and turbulent spray flames in dual-fuel engines are also discussed. Finally, outlooks and further challenges for the research field are outlined.}

  abstract = {Spray ignition represents a critical process in numerous propulsion and energy conversion devices. Compared to a gaseous mixture, ignition in a spray is significantly more complex, as the state of ignition in the latter case can be defined by three distinct ignition modes namely, droplet ignition, droplet cluster ignition, and spray ignition. Ignition for an individual droplet represents the appearance of a flame surrounding the droplet or in the wake region, with a dimension on the order of droplet diameter. The cluster or group ignition refers to the ignition around or inside a droplet cloud, while the spray ignition implies the appearance of a global flame with a characteristic dimension few orders of magnitude larger than a droplet. In all three modes, ignition is preceded by the evaporation of fuel droplets, formation of a combustible gaseous fuel-air mixture, and initiation of chemical reactions producing sufficient radical species. The identification of the dominant ignition mode for given two-phase properties represents a problem of significant fundamental and practical importance. Research dealing with laminar and turbulent spray ignition has been reviewed by Aggarwal [1] and Mastorakos [2], respectively, while Annamalai and Ryan [3] have provided a review of droplet group combustion/ignition. In the present review, we discuss experimental, theoretical, and computational research dealing with individual droplet ignition. Topics include the quasi-steady and unsteady models for the ignition of a fuel droplet in a stagnant environment, the droplet ignition in a high-pressure environment, the convective effects on droplet ignition, and multicomponent fuel droplet ignition. Studies dealing with the two-stage and NTC ignition behavior for a droplet are also discussed. Finally, relationship between the droplet ignition mode to droplet cluster and spray ignition modes is briefly described. Potential topics for further research are outlined.}

The models considered are those used in droplet laden flow calculations such as direct numerical simulations for which large numbers of individual (isolated) droplet solutions are obtained. Diameter and temperature evolution predictions are made for single-component droplets of benzene, decane, heptane, hexane and water with relatively large initial sizes ~1mm vaporizing in convective air flows. All of the models perform nearly identically for low evaporation rates at gas temperatures significantly lower than the boiling temperature. For gas temperatures at and above the boiling point, large deviations are found between the various model predictions. The simulated results reveal that non-equilibrium effects become significant when the initial droplet diameter is <50Œºm and that these effects are enhanced with increasing slip velocity. It is additionally observed that constant properties can be used throughout each simulation if both the gas and vapor values are calculated at either the wet-bulb or boiling temperature. The models based on the Langmuir-Knudsen law and'a corrected (for evaporation effects) analytical heat transfer expression derived from the quasi-steady gas phase assumption are shown to agree most favorably with a wide variety of experimental results. Since the experimental droplet sizes are all much larger than the limit for non-equilibrium effects to be important, for these conditions the most crucial aspect of the current Langmuir-Knudsen models is t'e corrected analytical form for the heat transfer expression as compared to empirical relations used in the remaining models.}

The critical parameter which controls the different evaporation modes has been identified to be the penetration distance of the outer flow into the cluster volume. A dynamic criterion has been developed to differentiate between penetration and no penetration. Convective evaporation was modeled using a Reynolds number correlation between the evaporation rate with and without convection. Other equations, previously developed [Combust. Flame51, 55-67 (1983)] f'r quiescent, nondilute-spray evaporation, have been used here as well, with the exception of a new kinetic-evaporation law at the droplet surface and a nonuniform interior temperature model which have both been developed here. The model is shown to perform well for low penetration distances which are obtained for dense clusters in hot environments and low relative velocities between outer gases and cluster. For dense clusters with low penetration distances the results of the model predict that for the same initial velocity the evaporation time is shorter as the cluster becomes more dilute. For dilute clusters and large penetration distances, the opposite was found. Since for large penetration distances the predictive ability of the model deteriorates, these last trends are questionable. Furthermore, the evaporation time was found to be a weak function of the initial relative velocity and a strong function of the initial drop temperature. The initial surrounding gas temperature was found to have a strong influence in the lower temperature regime, 750-1500 K, where's in the higher temperature regime the influence was very weak. The vitiation of the ambient gas by fuel vapor was found to have a very small influence upon the evaporation time for rich mixtures when the cluster is introduced in a strongly convective, high temperature surroundings. In all cases the results show that the interior drop-temperature was transient throughout the drop lifetime, but nonuniformities in the temperature persisted up to at most the first third of the total evaporation time.}

The objective of this paper is to explore the impact of the vaporization of a multicomponent liquid fuel on the combustion kinetics using an opposed-flow diffusion flame model. The model fuel consisted of a n-heptane, n-dodecane, and n-hexadecane mixture, selected to represent a Fischer-Tropsch fuel. A computational model is developed to describe the multicomponent vaporization process. Gas-phase chemical kinetics is modeled using a reduced mechanism containing 196 species. Results compare pre-vaporized fuel streams with those containing monodispersed initial droplet sizes of 20, 25 and 30Œºm. The separation distance between the fuel and air inlets is either 5 and 10mm. In all cases the fuel is carried in nitrogen, the pressure is 10atm, and the fuel and air inlet velocities are 1ms-1. The fuel loading is set to achieve an overall equivalence ratio of unity. Results show that the finite evaporation rate significantly impacts the chemical kinetics. In particular, if the combination of separation length, stream velocity, and fuel volatility is such that fuel droplets penetrate into the higher temperature region near the flame-front, the rapid increase in evaporation rate significantly enhances the local vapor phase fuel mole fraction. The high temperature increases reaction rates, leading to higher peak temperatures as well as increased pyrolysis in the pre-flame region. For example, the peak temperature predicted for 30Œºm droplets is 330K higher than that for the pre-vaporized case. This increase occurs in spite of an initial decrease in temperature as a consequence of fuel vaporization. A similar effect is observed for the pre-flame pyrolysis products; ethylene, acetylene, and butadiene all increase by about a factor of two for the 30Œºm droplet case. The implications of these findings regarding the use of alternative fuels is discussed.}

A modified version of an existing Lagrangian transient one-dimensional reacting flow code was used in spherical coordinates to capture the controlling mechanisms of ignition. The results showed that the ignition delay time decreases as the light component (propane) concentration increases. Additionally, the ignition delay time was found to increase with the droplet radius, due to the lower diffusion fluxes. Reaction pathway analysis provided insight into the interplay of the kinetics of the two components and their effect on the ignition. It was determined that the concentration of propane (the lighter and more volatile component) is dominant in the gas phase at the early stages of evaporation, and, as a result, it drives the droplet ignition process.}

The study is based on the Effective Thermal Conductivity Model (ECM) and Effective Diffusivity Model (EDM), which take into account the finite thermal/mass diffusivities inside the droplets and also consider the effect of droplet internal recirculation. Three sets of cases are considered: ideal liquid and gas phases, non-ideal liquid and gas phases and ideal gas phase together with the non-consideration of the Poynting factor for the liquid phase. The activity coefficients for the non-ideal liquid phase are calculated through the UNIFAC model and the fugacity coefficients for the non-ideal gas phase are calculated from the Virial equation of state. A parametric study is performed with focus on relevant conditions to direct injection internal combustion engines, within an ambient pressure range from 1 to 20 bar, initial ambient gas temperature range from 453 K to 673 K and initial ethanol volume fraction inside the droplet varying from 0 to 1. The thermodynamic analysis of the mixture, the time evolution of the droplet surface temperature and mass fraction together with the droplet lifetimes are presented for several different conditions. The obtained results show that the effect of the non-ideality of both phases has a significant impact on the results when analyzing ethanol/iso-octane mixtures. From cases analyzed considering both phases as ideal mixtures the deviation of the droplet lifetime reached maximum values (in absolute value) of 15.6% at 1 bar, 10.5% at 10 bar and 14.9% at 20 bar and for the ideal gas approach (non-ideal liquid) the deviation reached maximum values (in absolute value) of 3.9\% at 10 bar and 9.4% at 20 bar, when compared to the non-ideal approach. These deviations certainly can lead to significant deviations in the prediction of the mixture formation in direct injection engines.}

Bio-oil, also called pyrolysis oil, is derived from non-food biomass via the fast pyrolysis process and is a potential substitute for petroleum fuels. The bio-oil composition considered was obtained from experimental analysis of wood-derived bio-oil using GC/MS. Vaporization of a single bio-oil drop at 800K was simulated, and results show continuous variations of the volume fractions of individual components in the drop. At the end of the vaporization process, only levoglucosan is left in the drop. The vaporization model for bio-oil was implemented into an engine simulation code to simulate a bio-oil spray in a constant-volume combustion chamber. Predicted vapor distributions of individual components indicate that at the early stage most of the vapor is acetic acid, hydroxyacetaldehyde, and hydroxypropanone. The present model was also extended to simulate the vaporization of mixtures of bio-oil and other practical fuels including diesel fuel, biodiesel, and ethanol. In particular, for the mixture of bio-oil and diesel fuel, a hybrid multicomponent modeling strategy was employed in which a continuous thermodynamics approach was used to model the diesel fuel present in the fuel mixture. Results show that bio-oil drops have longer lifetime than other fuels and the presence of bio-oil in the fuel mixtures extends the drop lifetime. The amount of bio-oil in the drop during vaporization evolves in a way determined by the relative volatilities between individual bio-oil components and the other fuel in the mixture.}

Dilute sprays are addressed first with respect to recent advances in measurement and modeling capabilities.

Computations of turbulent dilute sprays flames are now able to reproduce the main experimental features although details for reactive scalars and droplet interactions with turbulence vary depending on the employed combustion model. In dense sprays, direct measurements in engines can now resolve useful details of the spray patterns and the extent of interactions with walls. However, diagnostic techniques in primary spray atomization zones need to improve significantly to provide sufficient quantitative information about liquid fragmentation rates. Calculations of spray jets in engines largely employ the ‚Äúblob‚Äù approach for the initial spray representation with a range of models for subsequent atomization. Various direct numerical simulations/large eddy simulation approaches are able to compute details of the primary and secondary atomization patterns and the results are employed to develop improved spray atomization models. These advances from turbulent dilute and dense sprays must be brought together to improve overall modeling capabilities in this field. }

In the case of unit Lewis numbers, a 1D manifold is sufficient to model the main effects of flame stretch. A manifold with two progress variables reproduces the results computed using detailed kinetics almost exactly. When non-unit Lewis numbers are used, the enthalpy and element composition of the burnt mixture change, which may influence the mass burning rate significantly. If these composition changes are included in the manifold using one additional controlling variable, the results agree well with detailed computations. }

  abstract = {Flamelet based chemical reduction techniques are very promising methods for efficient and accurate modeling of premixed flames. Over the years the Flamelet Generated Manifold (FGM) technique has been developed by the Combustion Technology Group of Eindhoven University of Technology. Current state-of-the-art of FGM for the modeling of premixed and partially-premixed flames is reviewed. The fundamental basis of FGM consists of a generalized description of the flame front in a (possibly moving) flame-adapted coordinate system. The basic nature of the generalized flamelet model is that effects of strong stretch in turbulent flames are taken into account by resolving the detailed structure of flame stretch and curvature inside the flame front. The generalized flamelet model, which forms the basis on which FGM is built, is derived in Part I. To be able to validate numerical results of flames obtained with full chemistry and obtained from FGM, it is important that the generalized flamelet model is analyzed further. This is done by investigating the impact of strong stretch, curvature and preferential diffusion effects on the flame dynamics as described by the local mass burning rate. This so-called strong stretch theory is derived and analyzed in Part I, as well as multiple simplifications of it, to compare the strong stretch theory with existing stretch theories. The results compare well with numerical results for flames with thin reaction layers, but described by multiple-species transport and chemistry. This opens the way to use the generalized flamelet model as a firm basis for applying FGM in strongly stretched laminar and turbulent flames in Part II. The complete FGM model is derived first and the use of FGM in practice is reviewed. The FGM model is then validated by studying effects of flame stretch, heat loss, and changes in elements, as well as NO formation. The application to direct numerical simulations of turbulent flames is subsequently studied and validated using the strong stretch theory. It is shown that the generalized flamelet model still holds even in case of strong stretch and curvature effects, at least as long as the reaction layer is dominated by reaction and diffusion phenomena and not perturbed too much by stretch related perturbations. The FGM model then still performs very well with a low number of control variables. Turbulent flames with strong preferential diffusion effects can also be modeled efficiently with an FGM model using a single additional control variable for the changes in element mass fractions and enthalpy. Finally FGM is applied to the modeling of turbulent flames using LES and RANS flow solvers. For these cases, the flame front structure is not resolved anymore and unresolved terms need to be modeled. A common approach to include unresolved turbulent fluctuations is the presumed probability density function (PDF) approach. The validity of this FGM-PDF approach is discussed for a few test cases with increasing level of complexity.}

  abstract = {This review attempts to summarize the physical models and advanced methods used in computational studies of gas-liquid two-phase jet flows encountered in atomization and spray processes. In traditional computational fluid dynamics (CFD) based on Reynolds-averaged Navier-Stokes (RANS) approach, physical modelling of atomization and sprays is an essential part of the two-phase flow computation. In more advanced CFD such as direct numerical simulation (DNS) and large-eddy simulation (LES), physical modelling of atomization and sprays is still inevitable. For multiphase flows, there is no model-free DNS since the interactions between different phases need to be modelled. DNS of multiphase flows based on the one-fluid formalism coupled with interface tracking algorithms seems to be a promising way forward, due to the advantageous lower costs compared with a multi-fluid approach. In LES of gas-liquid two-phase jet flows, subgrid-scale (SGS) models for complex multiphase flows are very immature. There is a lack of well-established SGS models to account for the interactions between the different phases. In this paper, physical modelling of atomization and sprays in the context of CFD is reviewed with modelling assumptions and limitations discussed. In addition, numerical methods used in advanced CFD of atomization and sprays are discussed, including high-order numerical schemes. Other relevant issues of modelling and simulation of atomization and sprays such as nozzle internal flow, dense spray, and multiscale modelling are also briefly reviewed.}

  abstract = {The effect of the wall-transpiration Reynolds number    R  e  V 0 on the large-scale rolls of the plane Couette flow with wall-transpiration is investigated using resolvent analysis. We observe streamwise-elongated large-scale rolls, moving closer to the suction wall and becoming narrower in the wall-normal and spanwise direction as well as shortened in the streamwise direction for growing    R  e  V 0 due to the decreasing characteristic length of the sheared region. Invariant scaling laws describing the growth of the amplification gain over various parameters and determining the optimal parameters yielding most amplification are found enhancing our understanding of the influence on the coherent structures, which can be used to predict their exact size. In a potential second step, this allows to manipulate and efficiently modify these flow characteristics increasing the functionality for various engineering applications as for mass, momentum and heat transfer, which is dominated by turbulent superstructures. For large enough wall-transpiration, the most amplified structures are oblique at optimal streamwise wavenumbers     Œ±  max ‚â† 0 growing linearly with    R  e  V 0. The optimal spanwise wavenumber Œ≤max yielding most amplified structures shows a polynomial dependence of second order on    R  e  V 0. For a constant ratio of the wall-transpiration and streamwise Reynolds numbers    Œ≥ =   R  e  V 0  R e, the most amplified structures occur at optimal streamwise Reynolds numbers represented by    R  e  max ¬∑  Œ≥ a = C. The amplification gain changes its trend from growing with Re2 to decreasing with    R  e  ‚àí 1.368 after Remax is reached.

The model used in the present study includes an alternative approach of describing the droplet combustion as a process where the diffusion of fuel vapor residing inside the region between the droplet surface and the flame interface experiences quasi-steadiness while the diffusion of oxidizer inside the region between the flame interface and the ambient surrounding experiences unsteadiness. The modeling approach especially focuses on predicting; the variations of droplet and flame diameters with burning time, the effect of vaporization enthalpy on burning behavior, the average burning rates and the effect of change in ambient oxygen concentration on flame structure. The modeling results are compared with a wide range of experimental data available in the literature. It is shown that this simplified quasi-steady transient approach towards droplet combustion yields behavior similar to the classical droplet theory.}

Analytical solutions are obtained for the predictions of the distributions of the temperature, concentrations of fuel vapor, and oxidizer in strongly and weakly interacting zones. Overall burning rate under internal group combustion mode at various flame penetration is also obtained. Numerical analysis is carried out to determine the combustion behavior of droplet clouds at some selected group combustion numbers. It was found that for a cloud of n-butylbenzene droplets, the group envelope flame is stabilized on the boundary of the droplet cloud for a group combustion number of 1.36. As the group combustion number decreases the envelope flame penetrates into the droplet cloud and divides the cloud into two zones; a strongly interacting zone located inside the group envelope flame and a weakly interacting zone established between the envelope flame and the boundary of the cloud. In the strongly interacting zone, the droplet vaporizes and the vapor produced is consumed at the group envelope flame. The droplets in a weakly interacting zone burn with an envelope flame surrounding each droplet. When the group combustion number decreases to 0.1, the group envelope flame degenerates into a point flame at the center of the droplet cloud.}

  abstract = {Internal combustion engines are the dominant power sources in transport, accounting for significant amounts of fuel consumption and pollutant emissions. Low-temperature combustion is a promising technology for engine combustion, whose main challenge is the complex control of two-stage auto-ignition that determines the performance of a low-temperature combustion engine. This paper systematically reviews the state-of-the-art advances in auto-ignition modeling which is an essential tool to understand auto-ignition mechanisms and provides valuable guidance for designing more efficient and cleaner engines. This paper focuses on turbulence, evaporation and chemistry effects without the consideration of inter-droplet interactions. Five models with increasing complexity are discussed and compared, including homogeneous models without and with evaporation (models 1 and 2), droplet simulation in static environments (model 3), and direct numerical simulation without and with evaporation (models 4 and 5). Rapid mixing leads to homogeneous conditions in models 1 and 2, in which two-stage auto-ignition is divided into low-temperature induction, low-temperature auto-ignition, high-temperature induction and high-temperature auto-ignition. Model 1 only considers chemical reactions and auto-ignition is determined for a certain thermal state. Droplet evaporation affects the auto-ignition evolution in model 2 through evaporation-induced changes in the thermal state. Compared with homogeneous models, droplet evaporation in model 3 leads to compositional and temperature stratifications which cause three new phenomena: preferential auto-ignition, reaction front propagation and non-zero scalar dissipationrate. Models 4 and 5 introduce turbulent effects on induction timescale and front propagation. Finally, challenges and future directions in auto-ignition modeling are outlined.}

  abstract = {Vaporization and two-stage autoignition of single droplets inside the droplet clouds were numerically studied using a spherical cell model. We aimed to investigate the behaviors of individual droplets in a moderately hot ambient (600-800¬†K) under the influence of surrounding droplets at atmospheric pressure. For a given ratio of distance between droplets L and the droplet diameter D0, autoignition only occurs when D0 is above certain critical value. Exemplar cases with L/D0¬†=¬†10 were used for detailed discussion as they are found to be near the autoignition limit. For droplets smaller than 400 Œºm, no ignition occurs and the surrounding gas phase is saturated by fuel vapor before the droplet completely vaporizes. A simple model of final saturation state was established. With this model, it was observed that when the gas phase in the droplet cloud is saturated, the temperature and fuel concentration distributions are insensitive to the distance between droplets. For droplets larger than 500 Œºm, a variety of autoignition processes including first stage ignition, cool flame burning, second stage ignition, and diffusional extinction are observed. Unlike single isolated droplets, such behaviors are primarily due to heat accumulation and limited supply of oxidizer that pertains to the scenario of non-dilute droplet cloud. Autoignition of individual droplets in a cloud only happens in the region where chemical time scale is smaller than the physical time scale for vaporization and diffusion. The temperature range of autoignition is broadened with increasing initial droplet diameter. Two potential mechanisms were identified for such broadening. Analyses of ‚Äòprobable droplet cloud autoignition (PDCA)‚Äô region were found to qualitatively predict the state switch of vaporization, cool flame ignition, and second stage ignition.}

  abstract = {The present study aims to extend the understanding of the external group combustion for droplet clouds under two-stage autoignition conditions. First, an exemplar case has been chosen to analyze the two-stage ignition behavior and flame structure. It was found that the fuel vapor transport of the droplet cloud is mainly supported by the thin vaporization layer near the edge of the cloud, which is the dominant factor of the ignition process. The case shows that a typical two-stage ignition includes the following detailed processes: first stage ignition, quasi-steady non-premixed cool flame, second stage ignition, and premixed hot flame. Three possible ignition modes for droplet clouds were identified through parametric studies, i.e. no ignition, single-stage ignition, and two-stage ignition. The transition between these modes is mainly controlled by the competition between chemical reaction and the vaporization of a thin layer of fuel droplets. Phase diagrams of different ignition modes at different ambient temperatures and sub parameters of the group number were presented. The previous group number G¬†=¬†2œÄndRc2 demonstrated unsatisfactory prediction in the ignition modes of the droplet clouds. Basing on the vaporization layer feature of the droplet clouds, a new dimensionless group ignition number with much better predictability is first proposed in this work, i.e. Gig¬†=¬†4œÄn2/3d2. The physical meaning of Gig is the dimensionless total surface area of droplets within a local layer.}

  abstract = {A dilute laminar spray flame of heptane was experimentally studied in a coflow configuration. The spray flame was characterized by using phase Doppler interferometric techniques and thermocouples. When burning in air, the flame had a candle-like appearance. It was naturally anchored a few millimeters above the burner through a stabilization annular flame. A droplet vaporization region could be visually identified above this annulus, as a relatively dark inner core. The spray burned in an internal or partial group combustion mode, with an inner core surrounded by a common flame and some droplets at the outer periphery burning individually. Thanks to the relatively narrow droplet size distribution in the spray, some characteristic parameters of group combustion theory could be computed from the experimental measurements reliably. In the region bound by the common flame, the ratio of interdroplet distance to droplet diameter ranged from 16 to an upper limit at least as large as 50, which shows the remarkable efficiency of droplet clouds at inhibiting oxidizer penetration within the core. A group combustion number, that was determined using the flame radius as cloud length scale, was found to be approximately constant in the lower part of the combustion region. This part of the flame was found to set the stage for the burning mode throughout the bulk of the spray flame. The value of this characteristic number was also consistent with predictions of group combustion theory for spherically symmetric spray flames burning in internal group combustion mode. Another aspect of the theory that found experimental confirmation was the transition from group combustion to individual droplet burning that was promoted via oxygen enrichment of the oxidizer stream. Such an enrichment caused two effects. The group combustion number decreased via a decrease of the flame radius. At the same time, the critical group combustion number Gcr for the transition to individual droplet burning, which is a function of the oxygen concentration in the free stream, increased. At sufficiently large oxygen concentration, the condition G < Gcr was eventually reached, resulting in individual droplet burning. Experimentally, as the oxygen concentration was raised, the percentage of droplets experiencing individual droplet combustion progressively increased. At a molar oxygen concentration of 0.62, the transition to individual droplet burning seemed complete, as manifested by the flame appearance as a collection of chemiluminescent streaks radiating from a common origin.}

A custom filter is used to remove interference from stimulated Raman scattering arising from the liquid fragments. Mie scattering is measured jointly on a separate camera to co-locate the fluid fragments with respect to the reaction zones. It is found that while the overall spray flame structure is similar to that of a turbulent gaseous diffusion flame, additional complexities arise due to the continuous release of fresh fuel vapor from the evaporating fragments. Structures referred to as burning rings of different sizes are observed, and these are ignited by interfacing with a hot edge before they grow, propagate, and burnout. Statistics on the occurrence of these rings, with and without clouds of liquid fragments within them, are presented. These findings are common to both ethanol and biodiesel, although measurements in the latter were affected by strong fluorescence interference from the excited components in the biodiesel blend.}

The initial turbulence in the carrier gas, the global equivalence ratio in the spray region, and the initial droplet size distribution of the spray were varied. Results show that spray ignition exhibits a spotty nature, with several kernels developing independently in those regions where the mixture fraction is close to its most reactive value ŒæMR (as determined from homogeneous reactor calculations) and the scalar dissipation rate is low. Turbulence reduces the ignition delay time as it promotes mixing between air and the fuel vapor, eventually resulting in lower values of scalar dissipation. High values of the global equivalence ratio are responsible for a larger number of ignition kernels, due to the higher probability of finding regions where Œæ=ŒæMR. Spray polydispersity results in the occurrence of ignition over a wider range of mixture fraction values. This is a consequence of the inhomogeneities in the mixing field that characterize these sprays, where poorly mixed rich spots are seen to alternate with leaner ones which are well-mixed. The DNS simulations presented in this work have also been used to assess the applicability of the Conditional Moment Closure (CMC) method to the simulation of spray combustion. CMC is found to be a valid method for capturing spray autoignition, although care should be taken in the modelling of the unclosed terms appearing in the CMC equations.}

The comparison with the experiment shows a good quantitative prediction of the velocity field of the gas and the liquid phases, in both non-reacting and reacting cases. Experimental and numerical results of the spray flame are also in good agreement. The detailed study of the interaction between the flame front and the droplets shows that both single droplet and group combustion regimes occur in the present configuration. These regimes are investigated from the numerical and physical points of view, highlighting the necessity to further investigate their possible importance for the modeling of two-phase combustion.}

Part I is concerned with the interactive processes for arrays, streams and clouds of drops while Part II presents a review of interactive processes for solid particles clouds. Isolated drop evaporation and combustion are briefly reviewed, as they relate to the interactive processes followed by approximate criteria for interactive combustion. The literature review reveals three distinctive types of studies: Arrays, streams and clouds in the areas of evaporation, ignition and combustion. An integrated approach starting from arrays to clouds and evaporation to combustion is presented. Array problems, analyzed with bispherical coordinates, method of images (MOI) and point source method (PSM) are reviewed. The results are briefly presented. Comparison of results between the different techniques and between the theory and experiment are given. A few of the array were interpreted with the ‚Äúpartial mass fraction‚Äù (analogous to partial pressure in thermodynamics) concept introduced in this review article. Convective effects on the array results are discussed. The point source resulting from the array studies are extended to the cloud problems by using the averaging technique for a statistically distributed cloud. The cloud problems of evaporation in confined and unconfined volumes, ignition and combustion are then reviewed. The relation of the results to spray combustion modeling is briefly discussed.}

Recent results on transient, convective burning of droplets in arrays are also examined. In particular, transient convective burning of infinite (single-layer periodic and double-layer periodic) and finite droplet arrays are discussed; attention is given to the effects of droplet deceleration due to aerodynamic drag, diameter decrease due to vaporization, internal liquid circulation, and arrays with moving droplets in tandem and staggered configurations. Flame structure is examined as a function of spacing between neighboring droplets and Damk√∂hler number: individual droplet flames versus group flames and wake flames versus envelope flames. Based on existing knowledge of laminar droplet array and spray combustion theory, experimental evidence, and turbulent studies for non-vaporizing and non-reacting two-phase flows, comments are made on the needs and implications for the study of turbulent spray and array combustion.}

Experiments were carried out with a single fuel droplet (a mixture of n-heptane and ethanol) suspended using the cross-wire technique within a box of turbulence facility that is capable of generating near zero-mean homogeneous and isotropic turbulence at its center. The fuel composition (i.e. the volume fraction of ethanol) as well as turbulent intensity within the chamber were varied over a wide range. The images of the evaporating droplet were recorded using back-light illumination. The initial droplet size was about 30-40 times smaller than the integral length scale of air turbulence, while it was about 10 times larger than the Kolmogorov length scale. For each fuel composition, five different turbulent conditions were considered. While the effect of turbulence was found to enhance droplet evaporation rate for all cases, the extent of its influence depends on fuel vapor mass diffusivity in air, and, in addition, on the initial fuel composition of the binary mixtures. The evaporation constant for the first stage of evaporation is sensitive to both air turbulence level and composition, while that for the second stage of evaporation shows a specific trend with fuel composition for all cases of turbulent intensity. Finally, an experimental correlation for normalized evaporation constant is presented.}

  abstract = {A single ethanol droplet evaporation through laminar methane/air stagnation flame is investigated at lean, stoichiometric and rich conditions experimentally and numerically. For the droplets having initial diameters of 20-70Œºm, the particle Reynolds number is measured via PIV/PTV, resulting in the slip velocity between the droplet and gas flow being small and the surrounding gas being able to carry without any significant convective effects. Evaporation rates, computed from Abramzon-Sirignano for a moving droplet towards a stagnation flame field, satisfy the ones computed from empirically determined evaporation rates from ILIDS measurements as a function of flame temperature, flame speed and flame thickness. Nevertheless, Abramzon-Sirignano model slightly overestimates the vaporization constant for lean cases. The distance traveled by the droplet after leaving the flame zone determines the average critical diameter. Accordingly, droplets larger than 18Œºm can cross the flame, leading to local modifications in the flame region due to heat loss and vapor diffusion from the droplet. Novelty and Significance Energy conversion in combustion should be carried out by optimizing efficiency, minimizing pollution, and preventing further climate change. The multiphase nature of spray combustion particularly adds further complexity due to the strong coupling of atomization, evaporation, mixing, turbulence, and chemical reactions. Although spray combustion involves a cloud of polydispersed droplets, it is of fundamental importance to understand the dynamics of an isolated droplet and its interactions with the flame front, which can provide indispensable information for spray combustion models. In this study, an experimental and computational framework has been developed to investigate droplet-flame interactions. The dynamics and evaporation characteristics of an isolated droplets interacting with stagnation flames have been determined by coupling several laser diagnostics, while further enhanced with Eulerian-Lagrangian simulations under flame conditions. Thereupon, the outcomes help the design of injectors of spray combustion systems and enhancement of evaporation models.}

In the present study, a fan-stirred spherical chamber was employed to generate a homogeneous and isotropic turbulent flow field with negligible mean velocity. This setup was used to investigate the effect of background vapor on the vaporization of a 500 ¬µm pentane droplet in a turbulent flow at elevated pressure and room temperature. Turbulence intensity and pressure were varied, respectively, from stagnant to 1.5 m/s and from 1 to 5 bar. Additionally, the background pentane vapor was altered (on molar basis) from 0 % up to 40 %. The results show that the d2-law is valid throughout all explored test conditions, including in the presence of background vapor. The findings indicated that the presence of background vapor around the evaporating droplet diminishes the droplet vaporization rate under both stagnant and turbulent flow scenarios, with a more pronounced impact at elevated pressure conditions. Furthermore, turbulence is observed to enhance the vaporization rate in the presence of background vapor, with its influence being more substantial at elevated pressure levels and higher concentrations of background vapor. Finally, the experimental data was used to correlate the coupled effect of ambient background vapor, turbulence, and pressure on the vaporization of a pentane droplet in terms of the flow turbulent Reynolds number.}

In non-premixed combustion systems, vaporization of the droplets and mixing of the vapour with the surrounding oxidizer control the overall rate of energy release. Droplet vaporization is affected by the nature of the liquid petroleum that contains species having extremely different volatilities. A fine understanding of multi-component droplet vaporization is therefore an important issue to optimize the combustion systems. This paper presents the application of a recently developed technique to measure the temperature of bi-component droplets. Based on the three-color laser-induced fluorescence (LIF) technique, droplet temperatures can be measured regardless of the composition. The method requires adding a small amount of a fluorescent organic dye to the fuel which is composed of ethyl-alcohol and acetone. The accuracy of the measurement is about ¬±1.3¬∞C. In this study, the emphasis is placed on the evaporation of the binary mixture in a hot air plume, the temperature of which (around 650¬∞C) largely exceeds the boiling point of the liquid components. An extensive study of the influence of the initial composition and droplet diameter is carried out. Finally, the experimental results are compared to an evaporation model based on the discrete components approach.}

The substitution of O2/He mixtures for O2/N2 mixtures results in a subtstantial increase in the oxygen index required for ignition, the rate of gasification, and the diameter at extinction. As a result, droplets with initial size larger than 1 mm can be produced, deployed, ignited, and burned to extinction, all under microgravity conditions in this facility. The droplet at extinction is sufficiently large (order of 0.3 mm) that photographic resolution and residual energy at extinction do not result in inaccuracies in determining the extinction diameter. A comprehensive time dependent numerical model incorporating detailed multicomponent molecular transport mechanisms and complex elementary chemical kinetics was developed and applied to simulate the entire transient droplet combustion processes (ignition/quasisteady burning/extinction). Model outputs consisting of droplet burning rates, flame stand-off ratios, flame temperatures, chemical species profiles, and temperature profiles at each time step show good agreement with the experimental measurements, without parameter adjustment. Analysis of modeling results shows that the thermal conductivity of the gas phase under combustion environments increased by a factor of two when the 50% O2/50% He mixture is used instead of air. The increased thermal conductivity accelerates the heat transfer from the flame, front to the droplet surface, resulting in a factor of two increase in the burning rate. The increased heat loss from the flame zone results in a factor of two increase in the extinction diameter. Comparison with d2-law results shows that property averaging rules which apply to droplet burning in air do not apply for helium mixture results.}

A very general, detailed kinetic scheme, consisting of ‚àº200 species and over 5000 reactions, is used to describe the gas-phase combustion of different fuels. Several comparisons with experimental measurements, carried out under various operating conditions, confirm that the proposed model is a useful tool for characterizing low-temperature and high-temperature ignition delay times. The predicted explosion diagrams of n-alkanes, as well as their ignition delay times, agree with the experimental measurements; the various oxidation regions are closely reproduced too. In addition to this, recent experimental results, relating to the influence of the initial diameter on droplet burning rates in cold and hot environments, are also presented and discussed. Lastly, an analysis of the extinction diameters for the combustion of n-heptane droplets allows a discussion of the role of radiative heat transfer, as well as further emphasizing the importance of the low-temperature oxidation mechanisms.}

The coldest ambience examined was room air, which utilized a heater wire to ignite the droplet. All other ambiences hotter than 633 K were acquired through an electrically heated air chamber in a stainless steel can. An inverse influence of initial droplet diameter on burning rate was demonstrated for the cold and hot ambiences. That is, the burning rate respectively decreased and increased in the former and latter cases with raising the initial droplet diameter. The reversion between the two influences appeared gradual. In the hot ambiences the burning rate increase with increasing the initial droplet diameter was larger at higher temperatures. A ‚Äúnet heat‚Äù of flame that denotes the difference between ‚Äúheat gain‚Äù by the droplet and ‚Äúheat loss‚Äù to the flame surrounding was suggested responsible for the results. In low-temperature ambiences there is a negative net heat, and it turns gradually positive as the ambience temperature gets higher and the heat loss becomes less. Relating to luminous flame sizes and soot generation of differently sized droplets clarified that the flame radiation, both non-luminous and luminous, is determinative to the net heat in microgravity conditions. In addition, the work identified two peak values of soot generation during burning, which appeared respectively at the room temperature and at about 1000 K. The increase in ambience temperature made also bigger soot shells. The heat contribution of flame by both radiation and conduction was demonstrated hardly over 40% in the total heat required for droplet vaporization during burning in a hot ambience of 773 K.}

The results are compared with previously reported data from microgravity drop tower, freely falling isolated droplet, and suspended droplet combustion experiments, all of which show significant departure from d2-law burning behavior and/or substantial water accumulation in the liquid phase. The liquid mass Peclet number (defined as the ratio of the droplet surface regression velocity to the effective diffusion velocity of water within the liquid droplet) is greater than 20 for methanol burning in air. The numerical model predicts little or no water accumulation for such circumstances. However, numerical results are consistent with experiments when it is speculated that sufficient internal liquid phase motion is present to reduce the effective liquid mass Peclet number to the order of one. Such internal motion has been noted in droplet combustion experiments and most likely arises from droplet generation/deployment techniques and/or surface tension gradients. Calculations show that the droplet combustion characteristics of methanol/water mixtures of 0%-50% initial water content are extremely sensitive to the liquid mass transport effects and might be used to better determine the magnitude of liquid mass transport present in microgravity experiments.}

The turbulent field was characterized using laser Doppler anemometry. Turbulent integral length scale was determined directly using two-point velocity measurements. It was found to be constant and independent of the turbulence kinetic energy level. The study was conducted at normal ambient room temperature and pressure conditions by systematically varying the turbulence kinetic energy and the fuel type for mono- and bicomponent hydrocarbon (n-alkane) droplets. The suspended droplet technique was used in this investigation with a quartz fiber of 0.2 mm diameter. Monocomponent hydrocarbon droplet burning was found to obey the D2 law, as well as bicomponent droplet burning of n-heptane and n-decane mixtures, where only one sequence was observed. This is not surprising since at high temperature conditions the bicomponent droplet burning is controlled by the least volatile component. Furthermore, the study of isolated single mono- and bicomponent hydrocarbon droplet burning under isotropic turbulence and zero mean velocity conditions showed that a spatially fluctuating flame envelopes the droplet and its extinction takes place for a turbulent velocity of the order of the propagation velocity of the associated hydrocarbon/air laminar premixed flame. The turbulence effect on the monocomponent and bicomponent droplet combustion rates before extinction was found to be negligible compared with the stagnant case.}

Methanol (CH3OH) is one of these alternatives, which was demonstrated in large fleet trials during the 1980s and 1990s, and is currently again being introduced in various places and applications. It can be produced from fossil fuels, but also from biomass and from renewable energy sources in carbon capture and utilization schemes. It can be used in pure form or as a blend component, in internal combustion engines (ICEs) or in direct methanol fuel cells (DMFCs). These features added to the fact it is a liquid fuel, making it an efficient way of storing and distributing energy, make it stand out as one of the most attractive scalable alternatives. This review focuses on the use of methanol as a pure fuel or blend component for ICEs. First, we introduce methanol historically, briefly introduce the various methods for its production, and summarize health and safety of using methanol as a fuel. Then, we focus on its use as a fuel for ICEs. The current data on the physical and chemical properties relevant for ICEs are reviewed, highlighting the differences with fuels such as ethanol and gasoline. These are then related to the research reported on the behaviour of methanol and methanol blends in spark ignition and compression ignition engines. Many of the properties of methanol that are significantly different from those of for example gasoline (such as its high heat of vaporization) lead to advantages as well as challenges. Both are extensively discussed. Methanol‚Äôs performance, in terms of power output, peak and part load efficiency, and emissions formation is summarized, for so-called flex-fuel engines as well as for dedicated engines. We also briefly touch upon engine hardware changes and material compatibility. Methanol fuel reforming using engine waste heat is discussed, as a potential route towards further increases in efficiency and decreases in emissions. Next to the experimental work, research efforts into modelling the behaviour of methanol as a fuel are also reviewed, including mixture formation, normal and abnormal combustion. Methanol‚Äôs properties such as high latent heat, fast burning velocity, high knock-resistance and no carbon-to-carbon bonds are shown to leverage engine technology developments such as increased compression ratios, downsizing and dilution; enabling much increased engine efficiencies. Finally, we point out the current gaps in knowledge to indicate which areas future research should be directed at.}

A spherically symmetric droplet model is developed for methanol using the hydrocarbon and nitrogen kinetic mechanisms developed at UC San Diego to account for chemical reaction rates. The inclusion of finite-rate chemistry allows for the capturing of the transition from diffusion to kinetically controlled combustion as the droplet diameter decreases. The droplet model is used to create a DFGM by successively solving the 1D flame equations at varying drop sizes, where the source terms for energy, mixture fraction (Z), and progress variable are cataloged as a function of Z and droplet diameter. A unique coupling of the spherical and planar FGMs is developed and is used to account for individual and group combustion processes simultaneously. Three combustion models are considered when modeling a methanol spray flame; (i) an evaporative model coupled with an unsteady planar flamelet-generated manifold (UFGM), (ii) using only the DFGM method, and (iii) the DFGM coupled with the planar UFGM. The models are compared against one another as well as experimental data for a methanol spray flame with an annular air jet. The DFGM model is shown to agree well with burn rates and normalized flame radii from individual droplet burning experiments. Good overall agreement is observed between the experimental data and the DFGM and coupled UFGM models for temperature, particle size distribution, and OH concentration.}

Advanced biofuels from second- and third-generation feedstocks can result in significantly reduced life-cycle greenhouse-gas emissions, compared to traditional fossil fuels or first-generation biofuels from food-based feedstocks. These advanced biofuels include alcohols, biodiesel, or synthetic hydrocarbons obtained either from hydrotreatment of oxygenated biofuels or from Fischer-Tropsch synthesis. The engine performance and exhaust pollutant emissions of advanced biofuels are linked to their fundamental combustion properties, which can be modeled using combustion chemical-kinetic mechanisms and surrogate fuel blends. In general, first-generation or advanced biofuels perform well in existing combustion engines, either as blend additives with petro-fuels or as pure ‚Äúdrop-in‚Äù replacements. Generally, oxygenated biofuels produce lower intrinsic nitric-oxide and soot emissions than hydrocarbon fuels in fundamental experiments, but engine-test results can be complicated by multiple factors. In order to reduce engine emissions and improve fuel efficiency, several novel technologies, including engines and fuel cells, are being developed. The future fuel requirements for a selection of such novel power-generation technologies, along with their potential performance improvements over existing technologies, are discussed. The trend in the biofuels and transportation industries appears to be moving towards drop-in fuels that require little changes in vehicle or fueling infrastructure, but this comes at a cost of reduced life-cycle efficiencies for the overall alternative-fuel production and utilization system. In the future, fuel-flexible, high-efficiency, and ultra-low-emissions heat-engine and fuel-cell technologies promise to enable consumers to switch to the lowest-cost and cleanest fuel available in their market at any given time. This would also enable society as a whole to maximize its global level of transportation activity, while maintaining urban air quality, within an energy- and carbon-constrained world.}

The growing concern about the emissions from internal combustion engines also impels the development of new energy sources to replace or reduce conventional non-renewable energy usage. In this context, hydrogen is found to be a promising solution in internal combustion engines to address these issues. The novelty of this review is to provide an overview of the use of hydrogen as internal combustion fuel, covering the operations in both spark-ignition (SI) and compression-ignition (CI) engines. Majority of the studies had shown that hydrogen enrichment fuels marked incredible engine performance in terms of thermal efficiency, fuel consumption and energy consumption. In addition, reductions in exhaust emissions such as smoke, soot, HC, CO, CO2 and NOx can be achieved in both SI and CI engines with proper operating conditions. Moreover, outstanding combustion behaviours were observed in both internal combustion engines with the application of hydrogen fuel. These enhancements were mainly attributed to the physicochemical properties of hydrogen, which exhibits higher calorific value and rapid flaming speed as discussed in this paper. To summarize, hydrogen utilisation in the IC and SI engines aided improvements in engine performance, exhaust emissions, and combustion behaviours under appropriate operating conditions and minor engine modifications such as ignition system and iridium spark plug for SI engines.}

Compared to typical hydrocarbons, ammonia's low reactivity characteristics and higher NOx emissions limit its practical implementation. However, the current need for decarbonization of the energy sector puts ammonia as an energy vector and carrier at the far front, making overcoming the challenges of ammonia utilization necessary. In late 2018, Kobayashi et al. presented a review article on the science and technology of ammonia combustion. In continuing their effort, this review is aimed towards giving the most recent updates in ammonia combustion. The article starts with the importance of ammonia as an energy carrier and covers the fundamentals of ammonia combustion. We then present recent activities for addressing the low ammonia reactivity and its impact on NOx emissions. In addition, the chemical kinetics of ammonia oxidation is presented through a discussion of recently proposed chemical kinetics mechanisms. This section emphasizes the role of crucial reaction differences, the updates in the NOx and De-NOx pathways, NHi recombination reactions and H2NO chemistry. Towards utilising ammonia in gas turbines and industrial applications, this review discusses recent efforts and various NO mitigation strategies. This work systematically summarizes the fundamentals of ammonia-based combustion and its application. It serves as a reference for the transition of ammonia into future practical applications.}

The chemistry is tabulated following the flamelet generated manifold (FGM) method. Enthalpy variations are incorporated in the resulting FGM database in a universal fashion, which is not limited to the heat losses caused by evaporative cooling effects.

Using one of the resulting cases from the evaporative cooling analysis as a reference, the importance of the flame wrinkling modeling is studied.

  abstract = {Large Eddy Simulations of dilute spray-air reacting two phase flow are performed following an Eulerian-Lagrangian approach. The method includes a full two-way coupling in which phase properties and spray source terms are interchanging between the two phases within each coupling time step. To achieve sub-grid scale closures in the filtered equations used for LES of the carrier phase, the Smagorinsky model with dynamic procedure is applied for the flow field while an eddy diffusivity approach is used for the scalar fluxes. The phase transition of droplets is captured using a non-equilibrium evaporation model. The evaporating droplets are tracked using a Langragian procedure. They are injected in a polydisperse manner and generated in time dependent boundary conditions. The combustion is described by a reaction progress variable and a mixture fraction as well as their variances in the line of the Flamelet Generated Manifold method. The ultimate objective of this work is to appraise the ability of this LES-based spray module developed here to retrieve the spray flow and combustion properties of the configuration under study. The configuration consists of a spray jet issued into a pilot flame and a co-flowing atmospheric air in which droplets traverse a pre-evaporation distance and release part of their mass before reaching the combustion zone. Thereby the spray pre-evaporation turns the combustion regime from diffusion to partially premixed. The fuel used is liquid acetone, which is modeled by a detailed reaction mechanism including 84 species and 409 elementary reactions. A series of spray established at different operating conditions are investigated, analyzed and compared. Analysis allows to gain a deep insight into the process ongoing. Comparisons include exhaust gas temperature, droplet velocities and corresponding fluctuations, droplet mean diameters and spray volume flux at different distances from the exit planes. An overall good agreement is reported.}

The test fuels were mixtures of n-decane (a surrogate fuel for kerosene) and alcohol (ethanol or butanol) with differing volumetric ratios. Since the test fuels are non-ideal solutions, the activity coefficient of each fuel component was calculated by using the UNIFAC method and was incorporated with the heat and mass transfer models to account for the non-linearity effect on fuel evaporation process. Single-camera and PIV (Particle image velocimetry) measurements yielded the velocity distributions of fuel droplets at two cross-sections of the spray cone with different axial distances. The Sauter Mean Diameter (SMD) of spray droplets were measured by a LSA-III Malvern particle size analyzer. For butanol-decane blends, all the three different models can predict the evaporation accurately with little variation. Whilst, prediction of evaporation for ethanol-decane blends suffers much more noticeable variation among the models because of the relatively higher saturation vapor pressure of ethanol. A great deviation between the predicted droplet size and the measured SMD was observed for E10 (10% ethanol by volume) because the activity coefficient of ethanol for E10, and thus the evaporation rate, is more susceptible to the variation of the ethanol mole fraction. The well mixed model can be considered suitable for predicting slow evaporation processes with low injection pressures.}

Vitiated air with different levels of dilution is considered to represent mixing of air with combustion products. Particular attention is given to the analysis of multi-component fuel effects at the various operating conditions. The investigation also considers the impact of fuel preheating and multiple initial droplet diameters, and extends to the quantification of NOx emissions at the droplet scale level. Considering pure evaporation, results show that preferential evaporation and variation of the droplet composition are mainly affected by the gas temperature. An increase of the pressure generally increases the duration of the droplet heat-up period and reduces the effects of preferential evaporation, especially when high temperatures are considered. Autoignition in vitiated air is strongly influenced by both the level of dilution and ambient pressure, with the latter playing an important role in determining the value of the initial droplet diameter below which no autoignition occurs. Lower pressures generally make the kerosene droplet more resistant to autoignition for the same level of dilution or gas temperature. Droplet preheating mainly affects the heat-up period and can be used as a design parameter to control the autoignition delay time. NOx levels are substantially related to the gas-phase temperature and the existence of a flame at the droplet scale. Potential implications for the design of future low-emission combustor technologies are discussed with an emphasis on the fuel preparation.}

  abstract = {A computational study of one dimensional multicomponent laminar Jet-A/air spray flames is presented. The objective is to understand the effect of various spray parameters (diameter, droplet velocity, liquid loading) on the spray flame structure and propagation. Simulation of the Eulerian gas phase is coupled with a Lagrangian tracking of the dispersed liquid phase. Jet-A surrogate of n-dodecane, methyl-cyclohexane and xylene is considered. A discrete multicomponent model for spray vapourisation is used along with an analytically reduced chemistry for computing the gas phase reactions. Both overall lean and rich cases are examined and compared with existing literature for single component spray flames. The preferential evaporation effect, unique to multicomponent fuels causes a variation of fuel vapour composition on both sides of the flamefront and this has a direct impact on the spray flame structure and propagation speed. In the rich cases, multiple flame structures exist due to the staged release of vapours across the reactive zone. Spray flame speed correlations proposed for single component fuels are extended to the multicomponent case, for both zero and high relative velocity between the liquid and the gas. The correlations are able to accurately predict the effective equivalence ratio at which the flame burns and hence the laminar spray flame speeds of multicomponent fuels for all cases studied in this work.}

  abstract = {Large Eddy Simulations of the realistic liquid fueled gas turbine combustor LOTAR operated at ONERA are performed for two fuels; a conventional JetA-1 and an alternative alcohol to jet fuel At-J, each modeled by a 3-component formulation. JetA-1 is composed of n-dodecane, methyl-cyclohexane and xylene each corresponding to the major hydrocarbon families found in real fuel. At-J is a synthetic drop in fuel composed of only branched chain alkanes, iso-octane, iso-dodecane and iso-hexadecane. Analytically Reduced Chemistry and multicomponent spray evaporation model coupled to the dynamic thickened flame turbulent combustion model are employed to understand the processes involved in turbulent spray flames in the LOTAR configuration. The objectives are to predict and understand the potential effects of staged vaporisation and consumption of the fuel components, and their impact on the spray flame structures. Simulations confirm the role of preferential evaporation in establishing and stabilising the reaction zone. JetA-1 evaporation zones extend deep into the rich burnt gasses resulting in a combustion regime with the possibility of droplet clusters burning individually. At-J which is more volatile, leads to complete combustion with the majority occurring due to the premixed lean reactions of the smaller pyrolysed components. The need to further include models capable of identifying and handling combustion regimes encountered in such spray flames is hence highlighted. This work is intended as a starting point for improving multicomponent spray modelling and requires additional experimental data for validation.}

In this study, the focus lies on conducting Large Eddy Simulations (LES) to comprehend the impact of species concentration changes in well-controlled multi-component fuel blends on flame structures. The SICCA-spray rig from the EM2C laboratory operated with three blends of n-dodecane and n-heptane in varying proportions, is specifically addressed and investigated in light of the available data. To conduct these simulations, the dynamically thickened flame model and an evaporation multi-component sub-model are coupled with a reduced chemistry mechanism for n-heptane and n-dodecane binary blends. Across all investigated blends, the simulated swirling spray flame predictions align well with the experimental measurements confirming the suitability of the proposed modeling. For this configuration, the alterations in species concentration do not appear to significantly impact the overall flame structures and characteristics when observed from an average perspective. However, localized differences are identified, revealing notable composition effects. The simulation outcomes indicate that the early consumption of n-heptane contributes to stabilizing the flame, whereas the vaporization of n-dodecane is the primary factor responsible for combustion occurring further downstream. These effects are closely tied to the evaporation properties of each fuel compound and their concentration proportions within the blend, as expected. This insight highlights the intricate relationship between fuel properties, their concentrations within blends, and the resulting combustion behavior, shedding light on the complexities of multi-component fuel combustion characteristics.}

  abstract = {The combustion of liquid fuels in a hot and low-oxygen environment is commonly encountered in a range of practical situations. To enable investigation of the fundamental combustion processes relating to such applications, liquid fuels were injected into the reaction zone as dilute sprays in this study. Droplets of ethanol, n-heptane, and n-heptane/toluene blends were produced via an ultrasonic nebuliser, and were carried by air through a central jet to a hot coflow of combustion products. The resulting flames were then analysed using four simultaneous laser diagnostic techniques. Planar laser-induced fluorescence (PLIF) was implemented to perform imaging of key intermediate species, including hydroxyl (OH) and formaldehyde (CH2O), while the Mie scattering technique was used to detect the location of droplets. The sooting behaviour of these flames was also investigated, via the laser-induced incandescence (LII) technique. The existence of distinct inner and outer reaction zones is a key feature of all of the flames studied, and this ‚Äúdouble flame structure‚Äù was found to be related to partial premixing of air and fuel, as well as penetration of droplets into the inner reaction zone. A change in the stabilisation of the inner flame front was observed with variations in fuel type, with a greater likelihood of ignition kernels in the case of the n-heptane and n-heptane/toluene flames, whereas the equivalent ethanol flame displays a bifurcation structure. Variations in the jet Reynolds number and liquid fuel loading were also found to have a notable impact on the distribution and evaporation of droplets, which was in turn found to affect the formation of the double flame structure. Due to the complex coupling between turbulence, chemistry and droplet evaporation in these flames, the accurate prediction of such results a priori is not within the limits of current modelling capabilities. These findings provide a valuable insight to enable future advancements in spray combustion modelling and the design of practical combustion devices.}

This configuration has been extensively studied in the literature for gaseous flames. In the present work, we extend this analysis and develop a spectral diagram for the description of spray flame-vortex interaction in analogy to purely gaseous flames in the limit of momentum equilibrium. The focus is hereby on the analysis of competing time-scale effects that are associated with droplet evaporation, mixing and reaction chemistry. Through this analysis, a new extinction scenario is identified that is specific to spray flames as a result of fuel depletion. The derived spectral diagram is confirmed by numerical investigations for n-dodecane counterflow spray flames interacting with a pair of vortices. The different extinction scenarios and their dependence on the evaporation time are numerically studied and verified.}

  abstract = {A model of turbulent sub-grid scale flame speed for premixed combustion is proposed and tested in Large Eddy Simulation (LES). The model is based on writing the unresolved flame surface density in terms of a general power-law expression that involves an inner cutoff scale. This scale is derived from an equilibrium assumption of flame-surface production and destruction. The flame-surface production term is modeled using a parameterization of the effective flame stretch, obtained from a spectral superposition of earlier DNS results of single vortex-flame interactions [8]. The model is implemented in a LES combustion code in the context of Thickened Flame LES (TF-LES) using an empirically chosen (non-dynamic) value for the power-law exponent. Three-dimensional simulations of premixed flame embedded in a time decaying isotropic turbulent flow are performed in several different parameter ranges. Comparisons between direct numerical simulation (DNS) and LES using different resolutions and thickness factors show that the LES reproduces the total reaction rate of the DNS quite well and independently on the thickness factor, resolution, and sub-grid scale model used for the turbulent eddy viscosity. Comparisons between the predicted overall turbulent flame speed sT as function of the r.m.s. velocity and experimental data show good agreement over a significant range of parameters.}
