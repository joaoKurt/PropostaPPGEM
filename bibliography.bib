  abstract = {A code was developed for numerical simulations of both nano- and micron-sized aluminum dust combustion in air. This code incorporates a combustion model that provides a comprehensive framework for modeling the burning of an aluminum particle under a transition regime, enabling accurate modeling of aluminum dust combustion across a wide range of particle sizes. The pseudo-transient approach was employed to solve the steady multiphase governing equations of aluminum dust combustion. The predicted variation trend of burning velocity with varying dust concentration exhibits good agreement with experimental measurements for both nano- and micron-sized aluminum dust combustion. Analyses exploring the effects of dust concentration, oxygen volume fraction and thermophoretic force on aluminum dust combustion were conducted. Simulation results indicate that introducing thermophoretic force in micron-sized aluminum dust combustion further enhances burning velocities and increases flame thicknesses compared to nano-sized aluminum dust combustion, primarily attributed to reduced gas entrainment of micron-sized aluminum particles.}

  abstract = {Turbulent combustion will remain central to the next generation of combustion devices that are likely to employ blends of renewable and fossil fuels, transitioning eventually to electrofuels (also referred to as e-fuels, powerfuels, power-to-x, or synthetics). This paper starts by projecting that the decarbonization process is likely to be very slow as guided by history and by the sheer extent of the current network for fossil fuels, and the cost of its replacement. This transition to renewables will be moderated by the advent of cleaner engines that operate on increasingly cleaner fuel blends. A brief outline of recent developments in combustion modes, such as gasoline compression ignition for reciprocating engines and sequential combustion for gas turbines, is presented. The next two sections of the paper identify two essential areas of development for advancing knowledge of turbulent combustion, namely multi-mode or mixed-mode combustion and soot formation. Multi-mode combustion is common in practical devices and spans the entire range of processes from transient ignition to stable combustion and the formation of pollutants. A range of burners developed to study highly turbulent premixed flames and mixed-mode flames, is presented along with samples of data and an outline of outstanding research issues. Soot formation relevant to electrofuels, such as blends of diesel-oxymethylene ethers, hydrogen-methane or ethylene-ammonia, is also discussed. Mechanisms of soot formation, while significantly improved, remain lacking particularly for heavy fuels and their blends. Other important areas of research, such as spray atomization, turbulent dense spray flames, turbulent fires, and the effects of high pressure, are briefly mentioned. The paper concludes by highlighting the continued need for research in these areas of turbulent combustion to bring predictive capabilities to a level of comprehensive fidelity that enables them to become standard reliable tools for the design and monitoring of future combustors.}

DFSW modeling strategies derived for single-phase flows are extended to improve the characterization of the mixture stratification encountered in dilute spray flames. The two-phase flow is described following an Eulerian-Lagrangian approach within the Large Eddy Simulation (LES) framework under consideration of two-way coupling between both gaseous and liquid phases. In particular, combustion reactions are captured by means of the Flamelet Generated Manifold (FGM) method. An evaporation model accounting for the inter-phase non-equilibrium is applied to address droplet's heat and mass transfer. Main aspects of the suggested DFSW modeling strategy are systematically analyzed. The obtained results demonstrate fair improvements not only in the estimation of the flame structure, but also in the prediction of the spray properties in comparison to a reference model and the available experimental data.

Analyses are conducted in terms of numerical simulations using a detailed description of the chemistry. Herein, different reaction mechanisms are employed to represent the combustion of methane. Simulations were performed with the computational fluid dynamics (CFD) code CHEM1D following different numerical setups, freely propagating flame, counter flow flame, and propagating flame in droplet mist reactors. The employed method is validated against experimental data and simulation results available in the literature. While the counter-flow flame reactor is exclusively used in the validation stage, different scenarios have been established for propagating flame simulations, as in single- or two-phase flow configuration. These comprehend variations in diluent compositions, reaction mechanisms, and different models to account for diffusion transport. Conducted investigations show that the choice for a specific reaction mechanism can interfere with computed flame speed values, which may agree or deviate from experimental observations. The achieved outcomes from these investigations indicate that the so-called GRI 3.0 mechanism is the best option for general application purposes, as a good balance is found between accuracy and computational efforts. However, in cases where more detailed information and accuracy are required, the CRECK C1-C3 mechanism demonstrated to be the best choice from the evaluated mechanisms. Additionally, the results clearly indicate that commonly applied simplifications to general flame modeling as the unitary Lewis number and mixture averaged approach strongly interfere with the computation of flame propagation speed values for single- and two-phase flows. While the application of unitary Lewis number approach is limited to certain conditions, the mixture averaged approach demonstrated a good agreement with the complex model for flame speed computations in the various tested scenarios. Such an outcome is not limited to oxy-fuel applications, but are straightly extensible to oxy-steam and air-blown combustion.},

These droplets are subject to heat and mass transfers in a vast range of atmosphere configurations, resulting in complex interactions. This example of spray combustion summarizes the diversity of scenarios that a droplet may experience in a spray flow. Unfortunately, available models in the literature exhibit limitations for characterizing such complex interactions. This work proposes a novel modeling strategy to account for such interactions in diverse scenarios grounded in a consistent computational approach. We derive a new formulation from general transport equations of the gas phase. We validate the resulting model by comparing numerical results with available experimental data and consider binary mixtures of liquids evaporating in different ambient conditions. Compared to other reference approaches, the proposed model proves to be efficient in all tested scenarios, including severe atmosphere compositions and states. Additional differential diffusion effects among participating species are observed, not only for mass but also for heat transfer.}

While many contributions focus on the description of the mass transfer, details about the energy formulation to describe the droplet's heat transfer are seldom developed in the literature. This work demonstrates that a general gas-phase energy formulation can be obtained independently from the species diffusion transport modeling while incorporating multi-species enthalpy diffusion terms with a simple expression. Considering the ideal gas simplification, it is shown that a simple choice of specific heats is sufficient to characterize the inclusion or not of multi-species enthalpy diffusion effects. Furthermore, it is also demonstrated that the final energy expression degenerates in the single-component limit to the same energy formulation as in the model of (Abramzon and Sirignano, Int. J.

Modeling strategies often rely on simplifying assumptions such as Fick's law or the Hirschfelder and Curtiss' approximation. This work seeks to propose a droplet mass transfer formulation based on the Stefan-Maxwell equations without simplifying assumptions for diffusion closures. Such an option has already been investigated by Tonini and Cossali (Int. J. Heat and Mass Transfer, 2016). However, critical simplifications were employed in the analytical developments. In this work, we relax these simplifications with a final model that handles any number of species in general phase-change scenarios (evaporation and/or condensation), applicable to convective environments, and with no hypotheses for the diffusion coefficients' structure, such that it can be regarded as a reference. To show the impact of diffusion simplifications, this formulation is compared with two other approaches representing most mass transfer models used by the literature. In particular, the model originally proposed by Law (Combust. and Flame, 1976) is detailed here since its core results are still among the most used. The proposed formulation is validated with experimental data, and simulations are conducted for droplets of multiple fuel compositions with fixed or varying conditions at the far-away state to map diverse scenarios.}

In this context, hydrophilic fuels are of particular importance, since they are expected to interact with the water formed during combustion reactions. The impact of such interactions onto the reaction process is still not explored enough. This work aims to contribute to the understanding of such interactions by investigating the impact of accurately describing the heat and mass transfers on hydrophilic fuel droplets interacting with flames. For that, a recently proposed phase change model is employed, demonstrated to be one of the few capable of characterizing the differential diffusion of vapor into the gas phase for hydrophilic fuels interacting with reacting flows. Numerical simulations of freely propagating flames in quiescent droplet mists are conducted with a detailed chemistry description. Different scenarios focus on the impact of water addition in the gaseous or liquid phase. Results demonstrated the multi-component phase change significantly impacts the flame speed in humid air and/or with hydrous ethanol, and neglecting this effect leads to strong miscalculation in flame speed. This is shown to be a consequence of the hydrophilic property of the chosen fuel, which allows the conversion from single-component to multi-component droplets, thus modifying the flame structure. Novelty and significance statement ‚Ä¢Differential diffusion is rigorously accounted for with a new phase change model in flames propagating in droplet mists of a hydrophilic fuel, i.e., ethanol.‚Ä¢The multi-component modeling is necessary even when considering the injection of pure hydrophilic fuel.‚Ä¢When the multi-component description of the liquid fuel is enabled, flame speeds become higher than those values achieved with the single-component approach.‚Ä¢Air humidity interacts with hydrophilic fuel droplets delivering higher flame speed values.‚Ä¢A novel justification is presented for the observed higher flame speed values of flames propagating in droplet mists when compared to single-phase flames.}

  abstract = {The differential diffusion of vapor species into the carrier gas flow strongly impacts the heat and mass transfer processes associated with multi-component droplets. While the importance of this phenomenon has been demonstrated for reacting spray flows, an evaluation of the most suitable method for its modeling is wanted. Recently, a new model was proposed (Sacomano Filho et al., Int. J. Heat and Mass Trans, Vol. 194, 2022) which rigorously accounts for the differential diffusion of species vapor into the carrier gas while allowing both evaporation and condensation of species at the same time. This model is used here as a reference and it is compared to two other models that have been used in combustion applications, based on stronger simplifications. While one neglects the differential diffusion of vapor into the gas, the other model follows from an important simplification hypothesis. With the objective to investigate the performance of these three models in terms of both their representation of physical phenomena and computational efficiency, simulations involving hydrophilic fuels are performed. Initially, simulations in single-droplet setup are conducted in non-reacting atmospheres with three main purposes: (1) validate implementations; (2) indicate model deviations; and (3) evaluate computational costs. Next, to analyze the performance of the three models in reacting flows, simulations of freely propagating spray flames are considered. Although deviations between models are noticed, results indicate the simplified differential diffusion model as a feasible choice to recover the main characteristics of a spray flame. In contrast, the omission of the differential diffusion description may lead to substantial deviations in various flame and spray parameters. Overall, the reference model is recommended as the most robust and rigorous approach for general spray flows, while the simplified differential diffusion approach, denoted here as Partial-DD, can offer the best compromise between accuracy and computational cost once it is rigorously verified for a specific set of conditions.}

  abstract = {In a real turbulent spray flame, dispersion, continuous phase turbulence modification, dispersed phase inter-particle collisions, evaporation, mixing and combustion occur simultaneously. Dealing with all these complexities and their interactions poses a tremendous modeling task. Therefore, in order to advance current modeling capabilities, it seems reasonable to aim for progress in individual sub-areas like breakup, dispersion, mixing and combustion, which however cannot be viewed in complete isolation. Further, one has to consider advantages and disadvantages of the general modeling approaches, which are direct numerical simulation (DNS), large eddy simulation (LES), simulations based on Reynolds averaged equations and probability density function (PDF) methods. Not least one also has to distinguish between Eulerian and Lagrangian dispersed phase descriptions. The goal of this paper is to provide a review of computational model developments relevant for turbulent dilute spray combustion, i.e. the dense regime, including collisions as well as primary and secondary atomization, is not covered. Also not considered is breakup in dilute sprays, which can occur in the presence of sufficiently high local turbulence. It is intended to guide readers interested in theory, in the development and validation of predictive models, and in planning new experiments. In terms of physical phenomena, the current understanding regarding turbulence modification due to droplets, preferential droplet concentration, impact on evaporation and micro-mixing, and different spray combustion regimes is summarized. In terms of modeling, different sets of equations are discussed, i.e. the governing conservation laws without and with point droplet approximation as employed by DNS, the filtered equations considered in LES, the Reynolds averaged equations, and Lagrangian evolution equations. Further, small scale models required in the context of point droplet approximations are covered. In terms of computational studies and method developments, progress is categorized by the employed approaches, i.e. DNS, LES, simulations based on Reynolds averaged equations, and PDF methods. In terms of experiments, various canonical spray flame configurations are discussed. Moreover, some of the most important experiments in this field are presented in a structured way with the intention to provide a database for model validation and a guideline for future investigations.}

One of the main objectives is to emphasize the progress made in the mathematical description and understanding of reactive spray flows by incorporation of rationally derived simplifications based on the disparity of length and time scales present in the problem. In particular, we aim to show how the disparity of the scales that correspond - with increasing values of their orders of magnitude - to the droplet size, interdroplet spacing, and width of the spray jets, ensures the validity of their homogenized description. The two-way coupling associated with exchanges of mass, momentum, and energy between the gas and the liquid phases is dominated by the homogenized exchanges with the gas provided collectively by the droplets, and not by the direct interaction between neighboring droplets. The formulation is used as a basis to address nonpremixed spray diffusion flames in the Burke-Schumann limit of infinitely fast chemical reactions, with the conservation equations written in terms of chemistry-free coupling functions that allow for general nonunity Lewis numbers of the fuel vapor. Laminar canonical problems that have been used in the past to shed light on different aspects of spray-combustion phenomena are also discussed, including spherical spray clouds and structures of counterflow spray flames in mixing layers. The presentation ends with a brief account of some open problems and modeling challenges.}

  abstract = {Turbulent multiphase combustion plays an important role in both nature (e.g., volcanos and pool fires) and industry (e.g., industrial furnaces, aeroengines, and internal combustion engines). It is a highly complex multiscale and multi-physicochemical process in which interactions between the dispersed and continuous phases, phase change, droplet collisions, evaporation, mixing, heat transfer, and chemical reactions occur simultaneously. In recent years, significant progress has been made in understanding the mechanisms of spray flames and their behaviors in combustion engines. This paper covers key and representative developments in the area of turbulent spray combustion with a focus on spray-chemistry-turbulence interactions. The effects of turbulence-chemistry, spray-turbulence, and spray-chemistry interactions on the spray process, ignition, flame stabilization and emission are comprehensively discussed at elevated pressures and temperatures. Furthermore, spray-radiation and spray flame-wall interactions, which are important to engine performance and emission characteristics, are scrutinized. Supercritical spray flames and turbulent spray flames in dual-fuel engines are also discussed. Finally, outlooks and further challenges for the research field are outlined.}

  abstract = {Spray ignition represents a critical process in numerous propulsion and energy conversion devices. Compared to a gaseous mixture, ignition in a spray is significantly more complex, as the state of ignition in the latter case can be defined by three distinct ignition modes namely, droplet ignition, droplet cluster ignition, and spray ignition. Ignition for an individual droplet represents the appearance of a flame surrounding the droplet or in the wake region, with a dimension on the order of droplet diameter. The cluster or group ignition refers to the ignition around or inside a droplet cloud, while the spray ignition implies the appearance of a global flame with a characteristic dimension few orders of magnitude larger than a droplet. In all three modes, ignition is preceded by the evaporation of fuel droplets, formation of a combustible gaseous fuel-air mixture, and initiation of chemical reactions producing sufficient radical species. The identification of the dominant ignition mode for given two-phase properties represents a problem of significant fundamental and practical importance. Research dealing with laminar and turbulent spray ignition has been reviewed by Aggarwal [1] and Mastorakos [2], respectively, while Annamalai and Ryan [3] have provided a review of droplet group combustion/ignition. In the present review, we discuss experimental, theoretical, and computational research dealing with individual droplet ignition. Topics include the quasi-steady and unsteady models for the ignition of a fuel droplet in a stagnant environment, the droplet ignition in a high-pressure environment, the convective effects on droplet ignition, and multicomponent fuel droplet ignition. Studies dealing with the two-stage and NTC ignition behavior for a droplet are also discussed. Finally, relationship between the droplet ignition mode to droplet cluster and spray ignition modes is briefly described. Potential topics for further research are outlined.}

The models considered are those used in droplet laden flow calculations such as direct numerical simulations for which large numbers of individual (isolated) droplet solutions are obtained. Diameter and temperature evolution predictions are made for single-component droplets of benzene, decane, heptane, hexane and water with relatively large initial sizes ~1mm vaporizing in convective air flows. All of the models perform nearly identically for low evaporation rates at gas temperatures significantly lower than the boiling temperature. For gas temperatures at and above the boiling point, large deviations are found between the various model predictions. The simulated results reveal that non-equilibrium effects become significant when the initial droplet diameter is <50Œºm and that these effects are enhanced with increasing slip velocity. It is additionally observed that constant properties can be used throughout each simulation if both the gas and vapor values are calculated at either the wet-bulb or boiling temperature. The models based on the Langmuir-Knudsen law and'a corrected (for evaporation effects) analytical heat transfer expression derived from the quasi-steady gas phase assumption are shown to agree most favorably with a wide variety of experimental results. Since the experimental droplet sizes are all much larger than the limit for non-equilibrium effects to be important, for these conditions the most crucial aspect of the current Langmuir-Knudsen models is t'e corrected analytical form for the heat transfer expression as compared to empirical relations used in the remaining models.}

The critical parameter which controls the different evaporation modes has been identified to be the penetration distance of the outer flow into the cluster volume. A dynamic criterion has been developed to differentiate between penetration and no penetration. Convective evaporation was modeled using a Reynolds number correlation between the evaporation rate with and without convection. Other equations, previously developed [Combust. Flame51, 55-67 (1983)] f'r quiescent, nondilute-spray evaporation, have been used here as well, with the exception of a new kinetic-evaporation law at the droplet surface and a nonuniform interior temperature model which have both been developed here. The model is shown to perform well for low penetration distances which are obtained for dense clusters in hot environments and low relative velocities between outer gases and cluster. For dense clusters with low penetration distances the results of the model predict that for the same initial velocity the evaporation time is shorter as the cluster becomes more dilute. For dilute clusters and large penetration distances, the opposite was found. Since for large penetration distances the predictive ability of the model deteriorates, these last trends are questionable. Furthermore, the evaporation time was found to be a weak function of the initial relative velocity and a strong function of the initial drop temperature. The initial surrounding gas temperature was found to have a strong influence in the lower temperature regime, 750-1500 K, where's in the higher temperature regime the influence was very weak. The vitiation of the ambient gas by fuel vapor was found to have a very small influence upon the evaporation time for rich mixtures when the cluster is introduced in a strongly convective, high temperature surroundings. In all cases the results show that the interior drop-temperature was transient throughout the drop lifetime, but nonuniformities in the temperature persisted up to at most the first third of the total evaporation time.}

The objective of this paper is to explore the impact of the vaporization of a multicomponent liquid fuel on the combustion kinetics using an opposed-flow diffusion flame model. The model fuel consisted of a n-heptane, n-dodecane, and n-hexadecane mixture, selected to represent a Fischer-Tropsch fuel. A computational model is developed to describe the multicomponent vaporization process. Gas-phase chemical kinetics is modeled using a reduced mechanism containing 196 species. Results compare pre-vaporized fuel streams with those containing monodispersed initial droplet sizes of 20, 25 and 30Œºm. The separation distance between the fuel and air inlets is either 5 and 10mm. In all cases the fuel is carried in nitrogen, the pressure is 10atm, and the fuel and air inlet velocities are 1ms-1. The fuel loading is set to achieve an overall equivalence ratio of unity. Results show that the finite evaporation rate significantly impacts the chemical kinetics. In particular, if the combination of separation length, stream velocity, and fuel volatility is such that fuel droplets penetrate into the higher temperature region near the flame-front, the rapid increase in evaporation rate significantly enhances the local vapor phase fuel mole fraction. The high temperature increases reaction rates, leading to higher peak temperatures as well as increased pyrolysis in the pre-flame region. For example, the peak temperature predicted for 30Œºm droplets is 330K higher than that for the pre-vaporized case. This increase occurs in spite of an initial decrease in temperature as a consequence of fuel vaporization. A similar effect is observed for the pre-flame pyrolysis products; ethylene, acetylene, and butadiene all increase by about a factor of two for the 30Œºm droplet case. The implications of these findings regarding the use of alternative fuels is discussed.}

Numerical simulations were carried out at a pressure of 20 atm, an ambient air temperature of 1400 K, various droplet radii (200/100/50 Œºm), and various liquid phase propane mole fractions (0.05/0.10/0.20/0.30/0.40) to investigate the effect of the light, i.e., more volatile component, on ignition. A modified version of an existing Lagrangian transient one-dimensional reacting flow code was used in spherical coordinates to capture the controlling mechanisms of ignition. The results showed that the ignition delay time decreases as the light component (propane) concentration increases. Additionally, the ignition delay time was found to increase with the droplet radius, due to the lower diffusion fluxes. Reaction pathway analysis provided insight into the interplay of the kinetics of the two components and their effect on the ignition. It was determined that the concentration of propane (the lighter and more volatile component) is dominant in the gas phase at the early stages of evaporation, and, as a result, it drives the droplet ignition process.}

The study is based on the Effective Thermal Conductivity Model (ECM) and Effective Diffusivity Model (EDM), which take into account the finite thermal/mass diffusivities inside the droplets and also consider the effect of droplet internal recirculation. Three sets of cases are considered: ideal liquid and gas phases, non-ideal liquid and gas phases and ideal gas phase together with the non-consideration of the Poynting factor for the liquid phase. The activity coefficients for the non-ideal liquid phase are calculated through the UNIFAC model and the fugacity coefficients for the non-ideal gas phase are calculated from the Virial equation of state. A parametric study is performed with focus on relevant conditions to direct injection internal combustion engines, within an ambient pressure range from 1 to 20 bar, initial ambient gas temperature range from 453 K to 673 K and initial ethanol volume fraction inside the droplet varying from 0 to 1. The thermodynamic analysis of the mixture, the time evolution of the droplet surface temperature and mass fraction together with the droplet lifetimes are presented for several different conditions. The obtained results show that the effect of the non-ideality of both phases has a significant impact on the results when analyzing ethanol/iso-octane mixtures. From cases analyzed considering both phases as ideal mixtures the deviation of the droplet lifetime reached maximum values (in absolute value) of 15.6% at 1 bar, 10.5% at 10 bar and 14.9% at 20 bar and for the ideal gas approach (non-ideal liquid) the deviation reached maximum values (in absolute value) of 3.9\% at 10 bar and 9.4% at 20 bar, when compared to the non-ideal approach. These deviations certainly can lead to significant deviations in the prediction of the mixture formation in direct injection engines.}

Bio-oil, also called pyrolysis oil, is derived from non-food biomass via the fast pyrolysis process and is a potential substitute for petroleum fuels. The bio-oil composition considered was obtained from experimental analysis of wood-derived bio-oil using GC/MS. Vaporization of a single bio-oil drop at 800K was simulated, and results show continuous variations of the volume fractions of individual components in the drop. At the end of the vaporization process, only levoglucosan is left in the drop. The vaporization model for bio-oil was implemented into an engine simulation code to simulate a bio-oil spray in a constant-volume combustion chamber. Predicted vapor distributions of individual components indicate that at the early stage most of the vapor is acetic acid, hydroxyacetaldehyde, and hydroxypropanone. The present model was also extended to simulate the vaporization of mixtures of bio-oil and other practical fuels including diesel fuel, biodiesel, and ethanol. In particular, for the mixture of bio-oil and diesel fuel, a hybrid multicomponent modeling strategy was employed in which a continuous thermodynamics approach was used to model the diesel fuel present in the fuel mixture. Results show that bio-oil drops have longer lifetime than other fuels and the presence of bio-oil in the fuel mixtures extends the drop lifetime. The amount of bio-oil in the drop during vaporization evolves in a way determined by the relative volatilities between individual bio-oil components and the other fuel in the mixture.}

Dilute sprays are addressed first with respect to recent advances in measurement and modeling capabilities. Comprehensive data banks exist for the velocity and droplet fields of such flows while measurements of temperature and reactive scalar fields are sparse and mixture fraction measurements remain a challenge. Computations of turbulent dilute sprays flames are now able to reproduce the main experimental features although details for reactive scalars and droplet interactions with turbulence vary depending on the employed combustion model. In dense sprays, direct measurements in engines can now resolve useful details of the spray patterns and the extent of interactions with walls. However, diagnostic techniques in primary spray atomization zones need to improve significantly to provide sufficient quantitative information about liquid fragmentation rates. Calculations of spray jets in engines largely employ the ‚Äúblob‚Äù approach for the initial spray representation with a range of models for subsequent atomization. Various direct numerical simulations/large eddy simulation approaches are able to compute details of the primary and secondary atomization patterns and the results are employed to develop improved spray atomization models. These advances from turbulent dilute and dense sprays must be brought together to improve overall modeling capabilities in this field. }

In the case of unit Lewis numbers, a 1D manifold is sufficient to model the main effects of flame stretch. A manifold with two progress variables reproduces the results computed using detailed kinetics almost exactly. When non-unit Lewis numbers are used, the enthalpy and element composition of the burnt mixture change, which may influence the mass burning rate significantly. If these composition changes are included in the manifold using one additional controlling variable, the results agree well with detailed computations. }
