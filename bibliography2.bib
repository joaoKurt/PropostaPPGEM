  abstract = {A code was developed for numerical simulations of both nano- and micron-sized aluminum dust combustion in air. This code incorporates a combustion model that provides a comprehensive framework for modeling the burning of an aluminum particle under a transition regime, enabling accurate modeling of aluminum dust combustion across a wide range of particle sizes. The pseudo-transient approach was employed to solve the steady multiphase governing equations of aluminum dust combustion. The predicted variation trend of burning velocity with varying dust concentration exhibits good agreement with experimental measurements for both nano- and micron-sized aluminum dust combustion. Analyses exploring the effects of dust concentration, oxygen volume fraction and thermophoretic force on aluminum dust combustion were conducted. Simulation results indicate that introducing thermophoretic force in micron-sized aluminum dust combustion further enhances burning velocities and increases flame thicknesses compared to nano-sized aluminum dust combustion, primarily attributed to reduced gas entrainment of micron-sized aluminum particles.}

  abstract = {Aluminum(Al) powder has been proposed as a promising dense energy carrier to store and transport abundant renewable power for a future carbon-neutral society. In this work, a detailed model for simulating Al particle cloud combustion with multiple oxidizers in the context of large eddy simulation is developed. The Al particles are tracked in the lagrangian framework with various sub-models including phase change, heterogeneous surface reaction, evaporation and radiation. The model is then employed to simulate turbulent jet flames with Al particles(d32=25 μm) in a hot co-flow. Tunable diode laser absorption spectroscopy(TDLAS) is used to measure the temperature and H2O distribution. The present model is first validated by comparing the predicted condensed Al2O3 distribution with the measured Mie scattering signals. The results indicate that the simulation results are in good agreement with the experimental measurements. Further comparisons of the temperature and H2O profile are then conducted. The numerical simulation predicts weaker mass and heat transport in the upstream and middle of the flame along the centerline of the burner, compared with the reconstructed TDLAS results, but the downstream scalar profiles of the jet flame agree well with the measurements. Discrete characteristics are observed in the simulated instantaneous temperature and condensed Al2O3 snapshots, which are due to the nature of heterogeneous combustion of metal fuel particles under fuel-lean conditions. Finally, the influence of the oxidizer mole fraction and the initial temperature of the primary jet on the ignition distance is analyzed. The results demonstrate that the ignition distance can be decreased effectively by increasing the oxidizer concentration of the hot co-flow or the initial temperature of the Al particles and carrier gas.}

  abstract = {Aluminum dust counterflow flames are investigated numerically using a two-stage model including the effects of interphase heat transfer, phase change, heterogeneous surface reaction (HSR), oxide cap growth, homogeneous combustion and radiation. The numerical model is first validated by simulating the aluminum dust counterflow flames of McGill University [Julien et al., 2017]. The results show that the particle velocity profile is consistent with the experimental results, and the error in the gas phase velocity caused by the use of aluminum particles as tracers in the experiment is analyzed. Then, further validation is conducted by comparison of the flame speed, and the predicted results agree well with the measurements. The flame structure of the aluminum dust counterflow flame is analyzed, and intermediate product (AlO) is observed to present a discrete distribution in space due to the nature of heterogeneous combustion. Different terms in the particle energy equation are analyzed, and the results indicate that the HSR plays an important role in the late preheating stage, while the interphase heat transfer dominates the rest of the conversion process. Under the assumption of unity Lewis number, the interphase heat/mass transfer models are found to have a great impact on the flame for a particle size smaller than 10 µm. With increasing particle sizes, the flame speed decreases, and most particles with a diameter of 12 µm cannot be fully burnt in the flame under the studied conditions. The effect of the strain rate on the flames is investigated with different particle sizes and unstretched reference flame speeds are obtained by linear extrapolation of the predicted results. Finally, a sensitivity analysis of the parameters of the heterogeneous surface reaction model is conducted.}

  abstract = {A numerical model for aluminum cloud combustion which includes the effects of interphase heat transfer, phase change, heterogeneous surface reactions, homogeneous combustion, oxide cap growth and radiation within the Euler-Lagrange framework is proposed. The model is validated in single particle configurations with varying particle diameters. The combustion process of a single aluminum particle is analyzed in detail and the particle consumption rates as well as the heat release rates due to the various physical/chemical sub-models are presented. The combustion time of single aluminum particles predicted by the model are in very good agreement with empirical correlations for particles with diameters larger than 10 μm. The prediction error for smaller particles is noticeably reduced when using a heat transfer model that is capable of capturing the transition regime between continuum mechanics and molecular dynamics. The predictive capabilities of the proposed model framework are further evaluated by simulating the aluminum/air Bunsen flames of McGill University for the first time. Results show that the predicted temperature distribution of the flame is consistent with the experimental data and the double-front structure of the Bunsen flame is reproduced well. The burning rates of aluminum in both single particle and particle cloud configurations are calculated and compared with empirical correlations. Results show that the burning rates obtained from the present model are more reasonable, while the correlations, when embedded in the Euler-Lagrange context, tend to underestimate the burning rate in the combustion stage, particularly for the considered fuel-rich flames.}

A suggested combustion model of a single aluminum (Al) particle is applied to the Lagrangian solver. The combustion model includes heat transfer in the transition regime (i.e., between a continuum and free-molecular regime), radiation, melting, surface reaction, aluminum vaporization in fuel rich and lean conditions as well as gas phase kinetics. The finite volume method based in-house code solves the particle dynamics and gas flow induced by the particle combustion to simulate flame propagation in a half-open tube. Numerical results are compared with experimental measurements. Both sets of results reveal a tendency toward the Al dust flame, which has a constant burning velocity in fuel-rich conditions and decreasing burning velocity in lean conditions. The numerical simulation analysis indicates that the constant burning velocity is due to the trade-off between the particle reaction surface and maximum flame temperature. Additionally, flame structures at different aluminum concentrations and heterogeneous characteristics are evaluated. The parametric study then examines the effects of thermophoretic force and particle diameter on the burning velocity.}

  abstract = {Aluminum particle burn rates are known to be a strong function of particle size as the mode of burning transitions from diffusion to kinetically controlled. To better understand the rate dependent diffusion and kinetic processes, a fully compressible, one-dimensional, spherically symmetric particle burn model is developed. Several cases are studied to explore the burning of aluminum particles in air, carbon-dioxide and steam environments. Predictions of burn rates versus particle size reveal significant deviations from a diffusion controlled burning limit - highlighting the importance of accounting for finite-rate chemistry in modeling the burning of sub-micron aluminum particles. While overall agreement to data is satisfactory, the detailed model cannot be directly used in system level tools due to computational cost. Two reduced modeling strategies are therefore explored to account for finite-rate chemistry effects in simpler models for use in system level CFD analysis. The first is an augmented D2-law where the finite-rate chemistry is treated as a perturbation to flame sheet approximation via augmented burn rate “constants”. Predictions using this approach of deflagration speeds in dusty aluminum-air gases agree well with experiments and show evidence of a maximum flame speed for a given mass loading. The second modeling approach uses a reduced numerical model and kinetics mechanism resulting in computationally efficient solutions. Results using this approach show up to two orders of magnitude reduction in computational effort while maintaining reasonable accuracy for predictions of flame structure, burn rates and burn times.}

  abstract = {Ignition prediction of aluminum particle is of great significance for a variety of propulsion and power systems to achieve optimal energy release within a limited residence time. In this study a heat transfer model employing temperature dependent coefficients was developed and validated to describe the heat exchange between quiescent/flow gas and aluminum particles from nano- to micro-size, covering the free-molecular to continuum regimes. By coupling heat transfer and aluminum oxidation, a theoretical model has been proposed to accurately capture ignition properties of both aluminum nanoparticle and microparticle (ANP and AMP) burning in hot oxygen atmosphere. Two formulas were obtained to predict the ignition temperature and ignition delay time for nano/micro particles, which show good agreements with experimental results, providing a convenient and accurate method for practical application. A parametric study illustrates that AMP ignition is affected by bulk flow velocity, radiation and oxygen concentration, particularly for AMP over 100 μm in diameter; in contrast, ANP is more sensitive to alumina thickness which generally raises both ignition temperature and ignition delay time. The present study not only deepens the fundamental understanding of aluminum combustion but also provides a guideline for prompting ignition.}

Also, the transition of combustion modes during the combustion process, which affects the growth rate of the oxide cap, needs to be explored. Therefore, a detailed combustion model of a single micron-sized aluminum particle is developed to predict the transition of combustion modes and the effect of the oxide cap. This combustion model consists of a vapor-phase kinetic model and a particle model coupled by the Strang splitting algorithm. The predicted ignition delay and combustion times are compared with experimental data to validate the combustion model. Three combustion modes including vapor-phase, transitional, and surface combustions are considered in this combustion model. We find that the two modes coexist for particles between 100 and 200 $\mu$m when the ambient temperature and pressure are 2500 K and 1 atm, respectively. A higher ambient temperature extends the transition of combustion mode toward smaller sizes. An oxide cap model considering surface free energy is proposed to study the growth and effect of the oxide cap on the combustion process of micron-sized aluminum particles. We find that the formation of oxide cap limits the evaporation rate of aluminum directly due to the reduced active surface area. The oxide cap stabilizes the evolution of particle temperature and determines the burning time. The predicted burning time is reduced by a factor of 2 at least considering the growth of oxide cap.},

Experimentally, an apparatus capable of producing Bunsen-type premixed flames was constructed to investigate the flame characteristics of bimodal-particle/air mixtures. The flame speed is positively affected by increasing the mass fraction of nano particles in the fuel formulation despite the lower flame luminosity and thicker flame zone. Theoretically, the flames are assumed to consist of several different regimes for fuel-lean mixture, including the preheat, flame, and post flame zones. The flame speed and temperature distribution are derived by solving the energy equation in each regime and matching the temperature and heat flux at the interfacial boundaries. The analysis allows for the investigation of the effects of particle composition and equivalence ratio on the burning characteristics of aluminum-particle/air mixtures. Reasonable agreement between theoretical results and experimental data was obtained in terms of flame speed. The flame structure of a bimodal particle dust cloud may display either an overlapping or a separated configuration, depending on the combustion properties of aluminum particles at different scales. At low percentages of nano particles in the fuel formulation, the flame exhibits a separated spatial structure with a wider flame regime. At higher nano-particle loadings, overlapping flame configurations are observed.}

  abstract = {This work addresses the role of heterogeneous reactions occurring during aluminum combustion. Direct numerical simulations are conducted on a single aluminum burning particle accounting for both detailed gas-phase and surface kinetic mechanism. A surface kinetic solver has been developed to take into account surface and gas/surface interactions. The model is validated against experimental measurements and appears to be predictive. Calculations are performed through different pressure regimes (1 and 10 bar), atmospheres (O2, CO2, CO and H2O) and droplet sizes (from 1 to 400 µm). Flames structures (temperature and AlO profile) computed by the model are consistent with experimental measurements and observations. The reaction zones for CO and H2O atmospheres are computed to be very close to the surface which is an evidence of a combustion mostly driven by chemical surface phenomena. In some cases surface reactions promote self-sustained combustion for smaller size particles at low pressure regimes. Calculated burning times are also consistent with experimental measurements. In O2/Ar, surface chemistry is more important when particles are small (under 20 µm) which guides the combustion to a more kinetically-limited regime than a diffusion-limited regime. The importance of surface reactivity is different regarding the particle size and the atmosphere of interest. Calculations of alumina residue size reveals that surface reactions could explain alumina residue formation. The model predicts a strong oxidizer effect on alumina residue size. According to the model, CO2 environment lead to large residue size while H2O environment lead to small residue size. This work definitely stresses the potential role of heterogeneous reactions in aluminum combustion.}

  abstract = {It is becoming widely recognized that our society must transition to low-carbon energy systems to combat global climate change, and renewable energy sources are needed to provide energy security in a world with limited fossil-fuel resources. While many clean power-generation solutions have been proposed and are being developed, our ability to transition to a low-carbon society is prevented by the present lack of clean and renewable energy carriers that can replace the crucial roles that fossil fuels play, due to their abundance, convenience and performance, in global energy trade and transportation. Any future low-carbon energy carriers that aim to displace or supplement fossil fuels must have high energy densities for convenient trade and storage, and should be consumable within efficient high-power-density engines for transportation, heavy machinery, and other off-grid energy applications. Hydrogen and batteries have been widely studied but they are not suitable for use as international energy-trading commodities and they cannot provide the energy density and safety demanded by society. Metal fuels, produced using low-carbon recycling systems powered by clean primary energy, such as solar and wind, promise energy densities that are competitive to fossil fuels with low, or even negative, net carbon dioxide emissions. To date, however, few practical high-power-density end-use devices for generating heat or power from metal fuels have been proposed. This paper proposes a novel concept for power generation in which metal fuels are burned with air in a combustor to provide clean, high-grade heat. The metal-fuel combustion heat can be used directly for industrial or residential heating and can also power external-combustion engines, operating on the Rankine or Stirling cycles, or thermo-electric generators over a wide range of power levels. A design concept is proposed for a metal-fuelled combustor that is based upon extensive experimental and theoretical studies of stabilized and propagating metal flames performed at McGill University. This paper also reviews the fundamental and applied aspects of metal-fuel combustion in order to provide the framework needed to assess any potential metal engine technologies. The energy and power densities of the proposed metal-fuelled zero-carbon heat engines are predicted to be close to current fossil-fuelled internal-combustion engines, making them an attractive technology for a future low-carbon society.}

  abstract = {Characteristics of aluminum combustion are summarized in an overview of the subject, focusing on the burning time of individual particles. Combustion data from over ten different sources with almost 400 datum points have been cataloged and correlated. Available models have also been used to evaluate combustion trends with key environmental parameters. The fundamental concepts that control aluminum combustion are discussed, starting from a discussion of the Dnlaw. The exponent in the Dnlaw is shown to be lower than two, with nominal values of ≈1.5 to 1.8 being typical. The effect of the ambient medium on the burning time is considered, oxygen as an oxidizer being twice as effective as water and about five times more effective than carbon dioxide. The effect of pressure and initial temperature is minor.},

  abstract = {Recent developments in modeling the heating and evaporation of fuel droplets are reviewed, and unsolved problems are identified. It is noted that modeling transient droplet heating using steady-state correlations for the convective heat transfer coefficient can be misleading. At the initial stage of heating stationary droplets, the well known steady-state result Nu=2 leads to under prediction of the rate of heating, while at the final stage the same result leads to over prediction. The numerical analysis of droplet heating using the effective thermal conductivity model can be based on the analytical solution of the heat conduction equation inside the droplet. This approach was shown to have clear advantages compared with the approach based on the numerical solution of the same equation both from the point of view of accuracy and computer efficiency. When highly accurate calculations are not required, but CPU time economy is essential then the effect of finite thermal conductivity and re-circulation in droplets can be taken into account using the so called parabolic model. For practical applications in computation fluid dynamics (CFD) codes the simplified model for radiative heating, describing the average droplet absorption efficiency factor, appears to be the most useful both from the point of view of accuracy and CPU efficiency. Models describing the effects of multi-component droplets need to be considered when modeling realistic fuel droplet heating and evaporation. However, most of these models are still rather complicated, which limits their wide application in CFD codes. The Distillation Curve Model for multi-component droplets seems to be a reasonable compromise between accuracy and CPU efficiency. The systems of equations describing droplet heating and evaporation and autoignition of fuel vapour/air mixture in individual computational cells are stiff. Establishing hierarchy between these equations, and separate analysis of the equations for fast and slow variables may be a constructive way forward in analysing these systems.}

The present work provides a comprehensive review of recent advances in the field of combustion of nano aluminum particles. The effect of the Knudsen number on heat and mass transfer properties of particles is first examined. Deficiencies of the currently available continuum models for combustion of nano aluminum particles are highlighted. Key physicochemical processes of particle combustion are identified and their respective time scales are compared to determine the combustion mechanisms for different particle sizes and pressures. Experimental data from several sources are gathered to elucidate the effect of the particle size on the flame temperature of aluminum particles. The flame structure and the combustion modes of aluminum particles are examined for wide ranges of pressures, particle sizes, and oxidizers. Key mechanisms that dictate the combustion behaviors are discussed. Measured burning times of nano aluminum particles are surveyed. The effects of the pressure, temperature, particle size, and type and concentration of the oxidizer on the burning time are discussed. A new correlation for the burning time of nano aluminum particles is established. Major outstanding issues to be addressed in the future work are identified.},

  abstract = {The re-examination of the classical droplet vaporization model is made in order to develop the simple but sufficiently accurate calculation algorithm which can be used in spray combustion calculations. The new model includes the effects of variable thermophysical properties, non-unitary Lewis number in the gas film, the effect of the Stefan flow on heat and mass transfer between the droplet and the gas, and the effect of internal circulation and transient liquid heating. To evaluate the competing simplified models of the droplet heating, the more-refined, extended model of heat transfer within a moving circulating droplet is considered. A simplified, one-dimensional ‘effective conductivity’ model is formulated for the transient liquid heating with internal circulation. As an illustration, the dynamic and vaporization histories of the droplets injected into the steady and fluctuating hot air streams are analyzed.
              On réexamine le modèle classique de la vaporisation de gouttelettes pour développer l'algorithme de calcul simple mais suffisamment précis qui peut être utilisé dans les calculs de combustion de liquide pulvérisé. Le nouveau modèle inclut les effets des propriétés thermophysiques variables, d'un nombre de Lewis différent de l'unité dans le film gazeux, de l'effet de l'écoulement de Stefan sur le transfert de chaleur et de masse entre la gouttelette et le gaz et celui de la circulation interne et du chauffage variable du liquide. Pour évaluer les modèles simplifés concurrents du chauffage de la goutte, on considère 1e transfert de chaleur dans une goutte avec circulation; une “conductivité effective” monodimensionnelle est alors formulée. Pour illustration, on analyse l'histoire dynamique de la vaporisation des gouttelettes injectées dans des courants d'air au repos ou fluctuants.
              Das klassische Tropfenverdampfungsmodell wird angepaβt, um einen einfachen, aber hinreichend genauen Algorithmus für die Berechnung der Verbrennung von Brennstoffnebel zu entwickeln. Das neue Modell berücksichtigt folgende Effekte: die Auswirkungen veränderlicher thermophysikalischer Stoffeigenschaften, die Abweichung der Lewis-Zahl für den Gasfilm vom Wert “eins”, die Auswirkung des Stefan-Stroms auf den Wärme- und Stoffübergang zwischen Tropfen und Gas, die Einflüsse einer internen Zirkulationsströmung und einer Aufheizung der Flüssigkeit. Um die in Konkurrenz befindlichen vereinfachten Modelle für die Tropfenaulheizung einschätzen zu können, wurde ein verbessertes und erweitertes Modell der Wärmeübertragung in einem sich bewegenden und zirkulierenden Tropfen betrachtet. Ein vereinfachtes eindimensionales Modell für die “effektive Leitfähigkeit” wird für den Fall der instationären Aufheizung der Flüssigkeit mit interner Zirkulationsströmung formuliert. Zur Illustration werden die Bewegungs- und Verdampfungsverläufe von Tropfen analysiert, die in einen stetigen und fluktuierenden Heiβluftstrom eingespritzt werden.

  abstract  = {Energy carriers are required to store and transport clean, renewable energy. Currently, most scientific efforts are invested in batteries and hydrogen despite several drawbacks, such as low energy densities and, for hydrogen, a serious risk of accidental or intentional explosions. Metal fuels, which present an inherently low safety risk and have high energy densities, have been proposed as advanced storage and transport systems for large quantities of clean energy but have received far less attention. Metal powders or sprays can be burned with air to produce heat, or can be reacted with water to produce heat and hydrogen. The hydrogen produced can then fuel either an internal combustion engine or a fuel cell. Metal fuel utilization produces metallic oxides, which can be captured and cyclically reduced back into metal fuels ad infinitum. The recycling process to produce metal fuels must use renewable energy to ensure an environmentally friendly cycle. A set of 5 constraints guiding the choice for potential metal fuels, along with the available commercial and research-stage green recycling techniques, lead to a selection of 7 different metals that could be used as recyclable fuels in the near future.}

Both, the steam combustion of molten Al for H2 and heat production, and a new rechargeable battery, which makes use of seawater and sodium as electrodes, show promising round-trip efficiencies. The latter technology also allows CO2-trapping, desalination, Na metal, and chlorine production. It is argued that further research efforts are needed to verify the sustainability and ability of reactive metal-based technologies to compete with other storage technologies.},

  abstract = {Metals are energy-dense fuels that can react exothermically with water to produce hydrogen, and this hydrogen is useful as a propellant for rockets and underwater vehicles or as a fuel for engines and fuel cells. Propulsion systems usually rely on high-temperature combustion (T>3000K) of metal-water propellants, while hydrogen-production systems typically employ low reactor temperatures (T<100°C). This paper reviews the current state of knowledge of both low-temperature and high-temperature metal-water reactions. Low-temperature reactions allow only the chemical energy contained in the hydrogen to be used, with the thermal energy released during the metal-water reaction being wasted. Metal-water propulsion systems typically make use of only the thermal energy of the metal-water reaction, with the hydrogen being exhausted to produce thrust. This paper proposes several novel applications of high-temperature metal-water combustion that allow the full chemical energy within the metal fuel to be harnessed, including high-speed air-breathing engines and high-power, compact, low-emissions power-generation systems. These technologies promise improved performance by maximizing the conversion of the chemical energy, stored within the metal fuel, into useful work at sufficient rates for high-power applications.}

  abstract = {The combustion of aluminum particle dust in a laminar air flow is theoretically studied under fuel-lean conditions. A wide range of particle sizes at nano and micron scales is explored. The flame speed and temperature distribution are obtained by numerically solving the energy equation in the flame zone, with the particle burning rate modeled as a function of particle diameter and ambient temperature. The model allows for investigation into the effects of particle size, equivalence ratio, and chemical kinetics on the burning characteristics and flame structures of aluminum-particle/air mixtures. In addition, the flame behavior with ultra-fine particles in the sub-nanometer range is examined by asymptotically treating particles as large molecules. Calculated flame speeds show reasonable agreement with experimental data. As the particle diameter decreases from the micron to the nano range, the flame speed increases and the combustion transits from a diffusion-controlled to a kinetically controlled mode. For micron-sized and larger particles, the flame speed can be correlated with the particle size according to a d-m relationship, with m being 0.92. For nano-particles, a d-0.52 or d-0.13 dependence is obtained, depending on whether the d1.0- or d0.3-law of particle burning time is implemented in the flame model, respectively. No universal law of flame speed exists for the entire range of particle sizes.}

High-speed videos unveil an unreported and complex mechanism in steam, not observed in other oxidizers. The detached flame is quite faint and very close to the surface. Alumina smoke around the droplet rapidly condenses and coalesces into a large, single orbiting alumina satellite. It eventually collides the main aluminum droplet while generating secondary alumina droplets. A unique feature is the presence of several distinct oxide lobes on the droplet, which merge only at the end of burning and encapsulate the remaining aluminum, possibly promoting an incomplete combustion. The measured burning times in pure water vapor are longer than expected and the efficiency of steam is found to be 30\% that of oxygen, lower than the usually accepted value of 60\%. A general correlation on burning time, including the major oxidizers, is proposed. Direct numerical simulations are conducted and are in line with experiments, in terms of burning rate or flame stand off ratio. Combustion in steam seems mostly supported by surface reactions, giving a faint flame with low gas temperatures and high hydrogen content. It is speculated that those two specific features could help explain the peculiarity of steam.}

  abstract = {This work presents experimental evidence that the transition from gas-phase diffusion-limited combustion for aluminum particles begins to occur at a particle size of 10μm at a pressure of 8.5atm. Measurements of the particle temperature by AlO spectroscopy and three-color pyrometry indicate that the peak temperature surrounding a burning particle approaches the aluminum boiling temperature as particle size is decreased to 10μm when oxygen is the oxidizer. This reduction indicates that reactions are occurring at or near the particle surface rather than in a detached diffusion flame. When CO2 is the oxidizer, the combustion temperatures remain near the aluminum boiling temperature for particles as large as 40μm, indicating that the flame is consistently near the surface throughout this size range. Burn time measurements of 10 and 2.8μm powders indicate that burn time is roughly proportional to particle diameter to the first power. The burn rates of micron- and nano-particles also show strong pressure dependence. These measurements all indicate that the combustion has deviated from the vapor-phase diffusion limit, and that surface or near-surface processes are beginning to affect the rate of burning. Such processes would have to be included in combustion models in order to accurately predict burning characteristics for aluminum with diameter less than 10μm.}

  abstract = {Experimental results on the combustion of single, isolated aluminum particles, laser ignited in quiescent environments consisting of pure N2O, CO2, CO and in mixtures of 21\% O2 / 79\% N2 and 21\%O2 / 79\% Ar are reported. Combustion measurements consisted of photographic observations and electron probe microanalysis (EPMA) of the condensed-phase product composition and radial distribution. Aluminum particles in O2, CO2, and N2O atmospheres were found to burn with envelope flames. Of these oxidizers, the largest flame envelope, as determined by the condensed-product distribution, occurred for Al combustion in the O2/Ar mixture, followed by Al combustion in the O2/N2 mixture, the CO2 atmosphere, and the N2O atmosphere. Combustion in the CO atmosphere appeared to occur on (near) the particle surface with only a weak envelope reaction. Consistent with previous results in the literature, Al particle disruption was not observed in O2/Ar environments, but was observed in O2/N2 environments. Although speculated in the literature, the present work confirms the existence of aluminum nitrides (oxy-nitrides) in the fuel-rich region near the particle surface for nitrogen-containing oxidizers (i.e., O2/N2 and N2O). Equilibrium calculations indicate that near the surface, solid-phase AlN may exist to temperatures well above the melting temperature of aluminum oxide. Thus, its presence may affect the fragmentation process. Finally, condensed-phase carbon (possibly in the form of aluminum carbide) was found throughout the surrounding gas-phase for CO combustion.}

In this model, the thermodynamic properties of large clusters (n = 5-75) have been determined by matching the thermodynamic properties of small clusters n = 2-4, calculated earlier by quantum-chemical methods, with similar characteristics of liquid droplets. The developed model was used for a numerical simulation of the formation of (Al2O3)n clusters during the combustion a single aluminum particle with a diameter of 200 μm in O2/Ar atmosphere. It has been shown that, during the first 12 ms after the aluminum particle ignition, the rapid growth of clusters occurs. The mass of clusters in the combustion zone is comparable to the mass of aluminum oxide. The modeling results indicate that the growth of (Al2O3)n clusters can be the most probable mechanism of the formation of condensation nuclei of alumina.}

Since the utilization of energy resources is the main source of GHG emissions, restructuring current energy systems in order to incorporate low-carbon energy technologies is essential for the realization of the LCS vision. Energy policies promoting the penetration of these technologies must view the role of energy in society as a system, composed of several energy resources, conversion technologies and energy demand sectors. The feasibility of the LCS in the future can be better understood by means of energy models. Energy models are valuable mathematical tools based on the systems approach. They have been applied to aid decision-making in energy planning, to analyze energy policies and to analyze the implications arising from the introduction of technologies. The design of the LCS requires innovative energy systems considering a trans-disciplinary approach that integrates multi-dimensional elements, related to social, economic, and environmental aspects. This paper reviews the application of energy models considering scenarios towards an LCS under the energy systems approach. The models reviewed consider the utilization of waste for energy, the penetration of clean coal technologies, transportation sector models as a sample of sectoral approaches, and models related to energy-for-development issues in rural areas of developing countries.}

Aluminum and water have also been proposed as a frozen propellant, and there have been proposals for other refrigerated propellants that could be mixed, frozen in situ, and used as solid propellants. However, little work has been done to determine the feasibility of these concepts. With the recent availability of nanoscale aluminum, a simple binary formulation with water is now feasible. Nanosized aluminum has a lower ignition temperature than micron-sized aluminum particles, partly due to its high surface area, and burning times are much faster than micron aluminum. Frozen nanoscale aluminum and water mixtures are stable, as well as insensitive to electrostatic discharge, impact, and shock. Here we report a study of the feasibility of an nAl-ice propellant in small-scale rocket experiments. The focus here is not to develop an optimized propellant; however improved formulations are possible. Several static motor experiments have been conducted, including using a flight-weight casing. The flight weight casing was used in the first sounding rocket test of an aluminum-ice propellant, establishing a proof of concept for simple propellant mixtures making use of nanoscale particles.},

  abstract = {Metals can serve as carbon-free energy carriers, e.g., in innovative metal-metal oxide cycles as proposed by Bergthorson (Prog. Energy Combust. Sci., 2018). For this purpose, iron powder is a suitable candidate since it can be oxidized with air, exhibits a high energy density, is non-toxic and abundant. Nevertheless, the combustion of iron powder in air is challenging especially with respect to flame stabilization which depends on the particle size distribution and the morphology of the iron microparticles among other factors. Models for the prediction of reaction front speed in iron-air suspensions can contribute to overcoming this challenge. To this end, three different models for iron particle oxidation are integrated into a laminar flame solver for simulating such reaction fronts. The scientific objective of this work is to elucidate the influence of polydispersity of the iron particles on the reaction front speed, which is still not satisfactorily understood. In a systematic approach, cases with successively increasing complexity are considered: The investigation starts with single particle combustion and then proceeds with iron-air suspensions prescribing binary particle size distributions (PSDs), parametrized generic PSDs, and an exemplary PSD measured for a real iron powder sample. The simulations show that, dependent on the kinetic particle model, the particles' thermal inertia, and the PSD, particles undergo thermochemical conversion in a sequential manner according to their size and every particle fraction exhibits an individual combustion environment (surrounding gas phase temperature and oxygen concentration). The local environment can be leaner or richer than the overall iron-to-air ratio would suggest and can be very different from single particle experiments. The contribution of individual particle fractions to the overall reaction front speed depends on its ranking within the PSD. The study further demonstrates, that although the three particle models show good agreement for single particle combustion, they lead to very different reaction front speeds. This is due to the different ignition behavior predicted by the particle models, which is shown to strongly influence the reaction front characteristics. Overall, the present work illustrates the complex relationship between characteristics of single particle ignition and combustion, polydispersity, and properties of reaction fronts in iron-air suspensions.}

This data together with the data of Eisenklam et al. cover the entire range of Reynolds numbers from 1 to 2000 and mass transfer numbers from 0 to 3. The present study shows that the drag coefficients as a function of Reynolds numbers correlate well with the “standard drag” curve provided the characteristic density is the free stream density and the characteristic viscosity coefficient is $\mu$r(Tr). The basis for the choice of these two characteristic properties is discussed. The present correlation is insensitive to the mass transfer number. This suggests that mass efflux has little effect on drag of evaporating droplets. Present study indicates that for the determination of the drag coefficient of any evaporative droplet at quasisteady state, one needs only to know the wet bulb temperature as a function of free stream temperature. This information is sufficient to calculate $\mu$(Tr). The “standard drag” curve can then be applied to determine the drag coefficient. }
